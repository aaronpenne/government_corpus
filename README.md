# Government Corpus and Scrapers
A collection of government texts and scrapers to get them.

## UCSB American Presidency Project

The best collection I could find for documents relating to the USA Presidency are [hosted by the UCSB American Presidency Project (APP)](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php). They have a great [search tool](http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/index.php#search), but I could not find a way to bulk download the documents to text files, thus the scraper.

Description from the APP site as of 2018-04-27:
