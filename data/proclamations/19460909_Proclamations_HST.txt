A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 all lands in public ownership within the area hereinafter described are within six miles of the exterior boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest and have been found by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Secretary of the Interior to be chiefly valuable for national-forest purposes; and
Whereas
 it appears that the addition of such public lands to the said forest would be in the public interest; and
Whereas
 the addition of such lands to the said forest makes it desirable for administrative purposes to extend the exterior boundaries of the forest to include within such boundaries the private lands, as well as the public lands, within the said hereinafter-described area:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the power vested in me by the act of February 2, 1922, c. 46, 42 Stat. 362, as amended by the act of May 24, 1935, c. 140, 49 Stat. 288, do proclaim (1) that the exterior boundaries of the Deschutes National Forest, in Oregon, are hereby extended to include all lands within the following-described area, and (2) that all lands in public ownership within such area are hereby added to and reserved as a part of the said forest, subject to any valid existing claims in such lands:
