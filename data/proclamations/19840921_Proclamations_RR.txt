By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The home sewing industry is important to our Nation's economy and is an activity shared by many Americans. Approximately fifty million Americans sew at home, and nearly forty million sew at least part of their wardrobe. Their initiative, creativity and self-reliance are characteristic of the people of our Nation. 
Sewing at home helps keep down the cost of clothing, and the sewing industry generates over $3,500,000,000 annually for the economy of the United States. Home sewing also enhances the career opportunities of many Americans in fields such as fashion, interior design, pattern-making, retail merchandising and textile design. 
In recognition of the importance of home sewing to our Nation, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 302, has designated the month of September 1984 as "National Sewing Month" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 1984 as National Sewing Month, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe September with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
