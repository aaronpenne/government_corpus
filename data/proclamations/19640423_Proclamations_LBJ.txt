A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 American mothers bear a major responsibility in the tasks of maintaining healthy home environments, of training their young ones with firmness and wisdom, and of guiding their children to mature citizenship; and 
AREAS the mothers of our Nation have, in succeeding generations, given their children their utmost devotion, and by their love, precept, and example have sought to endow them with the ideals, qualities, and strength of a great people; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate that we should join on one day of each year in acknowledging and expressing the gratitude we share for our own mothers and for the blessings of motherhood; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), the Congress designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its observance in accordance with the provisions of that resolution: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 10, 1964, be observed as Mother's Day; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the .flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. 
I also call upon the people of this Nation to render public and private expression of their love and reverence for their mothers on that day through the display of the flag at their homes or other suitable places, through prayers, and through other manifestations of their esteem and devotion. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-third day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
