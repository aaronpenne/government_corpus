By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 504(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 1974 Act) (a)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with respect to any article or any country after considering the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and 2462(c)). Accordingly, after taking into account the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to withdraw the duty-free treatment afforded under the GSP to imports from Malaysia of vulcanized rubber thread and cord provided for in heading 4007.00.00 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS). 
2. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 501, 502(c), 504(a)(1), and 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) In order to provide that Malaysia should no longer be treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to HTS heading 4007.00.00 for purposes of the GSP, the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn for HTS heading 4007.00.00 is modified: (i) by deleting the symbol "A" in parentheses, and (ii) by inserting the symbol "A*" in lieu thereof. 
(2) In order to provide that Malaysia should no longer be treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to HTS heading 4007.00.00 for purposes of the GSP, general note 3(c)(ii)(D) to the HTS is modified by adding, in numerical sequence, "4007.00.00 Malaysia". 
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. 
(4) The modifications to the HTS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after 15 days after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
