A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress has designated the eleventh of November as a legal holiday to be known as Veterans Day, and has dedicated it to the cause of world peace (Act of May 13, 1938, 52 Stat. 351, as amended (5 U.S.C. 87a)) ; and 
Whereas
 this day has an important dual significance in that it gives each one of us an opportunity both to honor the dedicated men and women of all races and religious beliefs who have honorably served in our armed forces in time of war, and to reemphasize our determination to achieve world peace with patience, perseverance, and courage; and 
Whereas
 each one of us should have an opportunity to participate in publicly observing the twofold purpose of this day: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, call upon the people of this Nation to observe Monday, November 11, as Veterans Day, remembering those who have borne the burden in time of war and resolving with one accord to achieve a just and lasting peace throughout the world. 
I request officials of the Federal and State Governments to work together with the Veterans Day National Committee so that this day may be appropriately commemorated by exercises and ceremonies in every part of our country. 
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Federal Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
