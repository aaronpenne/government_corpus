A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 in this era of challenging scientific discoveries, new lanes of thinking are needed to reach understanding of undreamed-of forces, to solve new problems of world community living, and to bring to bear upon human relationships in new and more effective ways the positive potentialities of our progress; and
Whereas
 inspiration in the quest for these new goals may be taken from the life and achievement of Christopher Columbus, who sought and who succeeded in finding new lanes across the ocean, new vistas for navigation, and new ways of understanding our planet; and
Whereas
, in recognition of the vision and superb accomplishment of that admiral, who dared and strove and opened a new world, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year, the anniversary of the sighting of land by Columbus's intrepid crew, as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, by this proclamation designate Sunday, October 12, 1947, as Columbus Day, and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in their homes or churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies. I call upon officials of the government to have the flag of the United States displayed on public buildings on Sunday, October 12, 1947, and I urge the school authorities and civic leaders of the nation to organize Columbus Day exercises appropriate to commemorate that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 6th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN

ROBERT A. LOVETT,
