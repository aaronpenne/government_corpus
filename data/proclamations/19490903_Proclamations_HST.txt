Accordingly, pursuant to the authority contained in the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, I hereby further modify the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so that (1) the quota year in respect of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more but less than l 11/16 inches in length shall hereafter commence on February 1 in lieu of September 20, and (2) during the period from September 20, 1949, to January 31, 1950, inclusive, the quantity of such cotton which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption shall not exceed 16,487,042 pounds.
