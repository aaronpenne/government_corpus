A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the destruction by forest fires in the United States involves an annual loss of approximately $20,000,000 and the devastation of approximately 12,500,000 acres of timberland and other natural resources, and
Whereas,
 the present deplorably large area of non-productive land is being greatly increased by 33,000 or more forest fires which occur each year, and
Whereas,
 the menace of a future timber shortage threatens to become a present economic fact seriously affecting our social and industrial welfare, and
Whereas,
 a large percentage of the forest fires causing the annual waste of natural resources may be prevented by increasing care and vigilance on the part of citizens:
Therefore, I, Warren G. Harding,
 President of the United States, do urge upon the governors of the various States to designate and set apart the week of May 22-28, 1921, as Forest Protection Week, and to request all citizens of their states to plan for that week such educational and instructive exercises as shall bring before the people the serious and unhappy effects of the present unnecessary waste by forest fires, and the need of their individual and collective efforts in conserving the natural resources of America.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 in the District of Columbia, this 7th day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-one and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-fifth.
WARREN G. HARDING
By the President:
CHARLES E. HUGHES, 
Secretary of State
