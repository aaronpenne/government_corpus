By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Section 104(b)(4) of Title 17 of the United States Code provides that when the President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States of America or to works first published in the United States, copyright protection on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the President may by proclamation extend protection under that title to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation, or which are first published in that nation. 
Satisfactory assurances have been received that as of April 10, 1987, the Republic of Singapore has granted to works of United States nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the United States protection in Singapore on the same basis as works of Singaporean nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in Singapore, and that such protection also has been extended to works of United States nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the United States, which were in the Singapore public domain on April 9, 1987, if such works still enjoy copyright protection in the United States. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by Section 104 of Title 17 of the United States Code, do declare and proclaim that the conditions specified in Section 104(b)(4) of Title 17 of the United States Code have been satisfied in the Republic of Singapore with respect to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national or domiciliary of the United States of America, or which are first published in the United States, and as of this day works of Singaporean nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in Singapore are entitled to protection under Title 17 of the United States Code. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 18th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
