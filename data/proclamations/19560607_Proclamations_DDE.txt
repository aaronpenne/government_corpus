By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Great Sand Dunes National Monument in the State of Colorado was established by Proclamation No. 1994 of March 17, 1932 (47 Stat. 2506), as modified by Proclamation No. 2681 of March 12, 1946,1 for the preservation of the great sand dunes and additional features of scenic, scientific, and educational interests; and
Whereas
 it appears that retention of certain lands within the monument is no longer necessary for such purpose; and
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude such lands from the monument; and
Whereas
 certain lands now a part of the Rio Grande National Forest are better suited for national-monument purposes than for national-forest purposes and should be excluded from such forest, and these lands and certain other land adjoining the monument are required for the proper care, management, and protection of the objects of scenic, scientific, and educational interest situated on lands within the monument; and
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as an addition to the monument:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), and the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (16 U.S.C. 473), do proclaim as follows:
