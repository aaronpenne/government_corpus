A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the strength of our Nation is dependent in large measure upon the existence of a prosperous and efficient land, air, and water transportation system; and
Whereas
 the continued prosperity and efficiency of our transportation system are the combined responsibility of the Government, the users of transportation, management, and labor; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that we recognize the importance to our country of the transportation industry by setting aside a week in which to pay special tribute to the men and women who move our Nation's goods and people; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by House joint resolution 602, agreed to May 13, 1960, has requested and authorized the President to proclaim that the week in May 1960 in which falls the third Friday of that month shall be designated as National Transportation Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 15, 1960, as National Transportation Week; and I urge all our people to join in appropriate activities and ceremonies with the various branches of the transportation industry and representatives of governmental agencies in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the people of each community to recognize the importance of a prosperous and efficient transportation system.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twentieth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
