By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
We seek, in the 1980s, an era of national renewal, an era that will set loose again the energy and ingenuity of the American people. 
Today there are 35 million disabled Americans who represent one of our most underutilized national resources. Their will, their spirit, and their hearts are not impaired, despite their limitations. All of us stand to gain when those who are disabled share in America's opportunities. 
To increase the participation of disabled persons in our national life and in the lives of other nations the United Nations has designated 1981 the International Year of Disabled Persons. America has long been a world leader in this area, and the United States Council for the International Year of Disabled Persons and our Federal government have already responded to the United Nations challenge. Programs are underway throughout the Nation. 
Through partnerships of disabled and nondisabled persons; of our private sector and our government; and of our national, state, and community organizations, we can expand the opportunities for disabled Americans to make a fuller contribution to our national life. I am proud to pledge the cooperation of my Administration and the Federal agencies under my jurisdiction, including the Federal Interagency Committee for the International Year of Disabled Persons. 
Now, Therefore, in keeping with the goals of the International Year, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim 1981 the International Year of Disabled Persons in the United States. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
