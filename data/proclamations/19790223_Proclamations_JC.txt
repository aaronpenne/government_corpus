By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 201 (d) (1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2951(d)(1)), the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) on December 12, 1978, reported to the President (USITC Report 201-36) the results of its investigation under section 201(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251(b)). The USITC determined that clothespins provided for in items 790.05, 790.07, and 790.08 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. In order to remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry that it has found to exist, the USITC recommended the imposition of a 5-year quota on U.S. imports of wood and plastic spring-type clothespins with a dutiable value not over $2.10 per gross provided for under TSUS item 790.05. 
2. On February 8, 1979, pursuant to section 202(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I determined to remedy the injury found to exist by the USITC through the proclamation of a 3-year quota on U.S. imports of wood and plastic spring-type clothespins with a dutiable value not over $1.70 per gross provided for under TSUS item 790.05. On February 8, 1979, in accordance with section 203(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(b) (1)), I transmitted a report to the Congress setting forth my determination and intention to proclaim a quota and stating the reasons why my decision differed from the action recommended by the USITC. 
3. Section 203(e) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)) requires that import relief be proclaimed and take effect within 15 days after the import relief determination date. 
4. Pursuant to sections 203(a) (3) and 203(e) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a) (3) and 2253(e) (1)), I am providing import relief through the temporary imposition of a quota on U.S. imports of wood and plastic spring-type clothespins with a dutiable value not over $1.70 per gross provided for under TSUS item 790.05. 
5. In accordance with section 203(d) (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(d) (2)), I have determined that the level of import relief hereinafter proclaimed pursuant to section 203(a)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a) (3)), permits the importation into the United States of a quantity or value of articles which is not less than the average annual quantity or value of such articles imported into the United States in the 73/78 period, which I have determined to be the most recent representative period for imports of such articles. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 203 and 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 and 2483), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), do proclaim that- 
(l) Part 1 of Schedule XX to the GATT is modified to conform with the actions taken in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(3) This proclamation shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after February 23, 1979, and before the close of February 22, 1982, unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly modified or terminated. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred-third.
JIMMY CARTER
