By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 an unusual lack of rain in the States of North Dakota, South Dakota, Nebraska, Texas, Missouri, Utah, and Nevada, and to a lesser extent in other States, has caused an acute shortage of feed for livestock, particularly in the affected area and else' where in the United States. . . .
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said Section [318] of the Tariff Act of 1930, and by virtue of all other authority vested in me, do hereby proclaim an emergency to exist and do hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to permit, until June 30, 1935 (unless before that date it has been determined by the President and declared by his Proclamation that the emergency has terminated), within such limits and subject to such conditions as he may deem necessary to meet the emergency, the importation of such feed for livestock as the Secretary of the Treasury may designate and under such regulations as he may impose, free of duty when imported by or directly for the account of any owner of livestock in any drought affected area, or by or for the account of any relief organization, not operated for profit, for distribution among distressed owners of livestock.
