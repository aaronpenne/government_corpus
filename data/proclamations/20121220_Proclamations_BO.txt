A Proclamation
 
1. The Russian Federation has been found to be in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (the "1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2431 
et seq.
) since 1994. The Russian Federation acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) on August 22, 2012.

2. Pursuant to section 102(a) of Public Law 112-208, I hereby determine that chapter 1 of title IV of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2431-2439) should no longer apply to the Russian Federation. 
3. The Republic of Moldova has been found in full compliance with the freedom of emigration requirements under title IV of the 1974 Act since 1997. The Republic of Moldova acceded to the WTO on July 26, 2001. The extension of permanent normal trade relations treatment to the products of the Republic of Moldova will permit the United States to avail itself of all rights under the WTO Agreement with respect to the Republic of Moldova. 
4. Pursuant to section 302(a) of Public Law 112-208, I hereby determine that chapter 1 of title IV of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2431-2439) should no longer apply to the Republic of Moldova. 
Now, Therefore, I, Barack Obama,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 102(a) and 302(a) of Public Law 112-208, do proclaim that:
