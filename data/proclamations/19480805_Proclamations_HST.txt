A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the National Guard of the United States has been a faithful and unflinching servant of the people in struggles against foreign aggression and in times of domestic disaster; and
Whereas
 the cause of national security demands that the National Guard be fully manned, equipped, and trained as a component part of the nation's security forces; and
Whereas
 September 16, 1948, marks the eighth anniversary of the call of the National Guard to the nation's service in the critical period preceding World War II:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in honor of the men of the National Guard who sacrificed their lives for their country and in recognition of those who served during times of national emergency as well as those who continue to serve in the interest of national security, do hereby proclaim Thursday, September 16, 1948, as National Guard Day. I invite the Governors of the several States to issue proclamations for the observance of National Guard Day, and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on that day.
I also remind all citizens that the National Guard of the United States, with each of its units in our hamlets and cities, is an essential part of the strength of our country, and I therefore urge that all citizens give their unremitting support to the men and units of the National Guard in their communities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
