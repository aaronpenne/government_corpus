By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Nearly 150,000 young Americans in junior and senior high schools throughout the country live by the Beta Club motto: "Let us lead by serving others." By striving for high standards of honesty, accomplishment, leadership, and service to others, Beta Club members are preparing themselves in the finest possible way for the responsibilities of citizenship and leadership which will be theirs in the years ahead.
To call public attention to the commendable activities and positive achievements of the Beta Club, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 19, 1972 (86 Stat. 917) has requested the President to designate the week which begins on the first Sunday in March, 1973 as National Beta Club Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of March 4 through March 10, 1973, as National Beta Club Week, in recognition of the significant contributions being made by Beta Club members to the well-being of our country.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
