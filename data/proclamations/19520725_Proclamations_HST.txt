A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (Public law 261, 82d Congress), the Congress of the United States has designated the 17th day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the formation and signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution of the United States and in recognition of all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, have attained the full status of citizenship; and
Whereas
 it is most fitting that every citizen of the United States, whether native-born or foreign-born, should on September 17 of each year give special thought and consideration to his rights and responsibilities under our Constitution; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid resolution authorizes the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Wednesday, September 17, 1952, and I urge the people of the nation to display the flag on that day at their homes and other suitable places.
I also urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as patriotic, religious, civic, educational, and other interested organizations to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on Citizenship Day in which all our people may join to the end that both native-born and naturalized citizens may have a fuller understanding of their rights and privileges and of their obligations and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.
And I call upon all our citizens to renew and reaffirm on that day their faith in the principles and ideals embodied in the Constitution - the foundation of our strength and the symbol of freedom and justice for all.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
