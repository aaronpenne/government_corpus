By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Thirty years ago a remnant of determined Polish Jews launched a resistance of desperation in the Warsaw Ghetto. All who took part knew that death would be the almost certain consequence, yet they readily chose that path in their struggle for freedom.
As we recall the valor of these honored and desperate heroes, we are mindful that the price of freedom is high. The debt we owe the gallant defenders of the Warsaw Ghetto is part of the same obligation all of us who live in freedom owe to those who refuse to capitulate in the face of invasion or violence. The names of these Warsaw Ghetto warriors are an inspiration to free men everywhere.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, in accordance with House Joint Resolution 303, do hereby designate the twenty-ninth day of April 1973 to mark the thirtieth anniversary of the uprising against the Nazi occupation forces by the beleaguered and outnumbered Jews of the Warsaw Ghetto who, by their heroic deeds, reaffirmed the determination of the oppressed to fight for freedom and dignity and thereby helped keep alive the spirit of liberty.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
