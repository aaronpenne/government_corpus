By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On October 10 we once again pay tribute to the great Italian mariner and explorer whose historic voyage of discovery led to the permanent settlement of the New World by the Old. 
With the support of the Spanish Crown, Columbus journeyed across uncharted waters to open the way for future generations of immigrants who would found the new nations of the Americas. 
As his heirs, we take pride in commemorating the spirit of Christopher Columbus as part of our national heritage. 
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified by the Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 10, 1977, as Columbus Day and invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable 1)laces with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer. 
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
