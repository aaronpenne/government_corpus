By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Foods from animal origin supply 70 percent of the protein, 35 percent of the energy, 80 percent of the calcium, 60 percent of the phosphorous, and important quantities of the "B" vitamins and trace minerals in the average American's diet. The application of scientific methods has markedly improved the efficiency of meat production in recent years and enhanced the desirability of these foods to consumers. 
During July 1983, the American Society of Animal Science is celebrating its seventyfifth anniversary. Its 7,500 members provide research, extension and educational services to all segments of animal agriculture in both the United States and other countries. 
In recognition of the great progress which has been made in the past seventyfive years in applying scientific principles to animal agriculture production and the role of animal products in our daily life, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 77, has authorized and requested the President to designate the week of July 24 to July 31, 1983, as "National Animal Agriculture Week." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 24, 1983, as National Animal Agriculture Week. I call upon the people of the United States and interested organizations to mark this week with appropriate observances to honor the contributions made by animal agriculture production to our economy. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
