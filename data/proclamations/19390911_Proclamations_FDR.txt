By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 509 of the Sugar Act of 1937 provides, in part:
"Whenever the President finds and proclaims that a national economic or other emergency exists with respect to sugar or liquid sugar, he shall by proclamation suspend the operation of Title II or III above, which he determines, on the basis of such findings, should be suspended, and, thereafter, the operation of any such title shall continue in suspense until the President finds and proclaims that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exists. . . . ";
Whereas
 the outbreak of war among major European countries has resulted in excessive and harmful speculation in sugar and rapidly rising prices to consumers, which conditions are accentuated by the marketing limitations imposed under title II of the Act; and
Whereas
 such increased prices of sugar will not accrue to the benefit of the majority of producers by reason of the sale of much of their current crop before the outbreak of the war:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the foregoing provision of the Sugar Act of 1937, do hereby find and proclaim that a national economic emergency exists with respect to sugar, and do by this proclamation suspend the operation of title II of that Act. 
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
