By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) was established by the United Nations in 1946.
UNICEF is dedicated to the welfare of children throughout the world—to eliminating the disease, hunger, and ignorance that afflicts them and their mothers.
UNICEF is one of the most successful international efforts the world has ever known.
The American people have actively and generously supported the work of UNICEF through their private efforts, and through the financial contributions of their Government. American children make their own very significant contribution through their annual Halloween collections for UNICEF.
Yet, despite past efforts, three out of four of all the world's children continue to suffer in the shadow of poverty, hunger, and disease. There is an enormous job still to be done—for the world's future depends on the wholesome, healthy development of today's children.
I hope that the American people, and the peoples of all countries, will continue to support UNICEF to the limits of their ability, both through their private efforts and through their governments.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, in honor of this great humanitarian enterprise, do hereby proclaim October 31, 1967, and October 31 in each subsequent year, as National UNICEF Day. I call upon all Americans, and particularly upon officials of the Federal and State governments and upon local officials and citizen groups, to engage in appropriate observance of this day in support of UNICEF.
In Witness Whereof,
 I here hereunto set my hand this 27th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
