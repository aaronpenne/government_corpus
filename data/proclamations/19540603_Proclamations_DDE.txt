A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 for many years June 14 has been set aside as Flag Day in commemoration of the adoption of our national emblem by the Continental Congress on that day in 1777; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we should observe the day by solemn rededication to those high principles of integrity which constitute the very foundations of our Republic; and
Whereas
 it is also fitting that we should remember that the Stars and Stripes symbolize our freedom, which we deeply cherish; our strength, which stems from the blessings that Providence has showered upon us; and our unity, which is the bulwark of the Nation; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), formally designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for a suitable observance of the day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby ask that on Flag Day, June 14, 1954, the people of the Nation honor our colors by displaying them at their homes or other suitable places and by giving prayerful consideration to their duties as well as their privileges as citizens under this glorious banner. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
