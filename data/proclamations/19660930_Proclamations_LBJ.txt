A Proclamation
In our Nation, the white cane is the symbol of the independent blind person, able to come and go on his own. For motorists in our streets and highways, the white cane also represents a caution signâ€”a reminder that it is upon their courtesy and consideration that the safety of blind persons depends.
To make our people more fully aware of the significance of the white cane, and to encourage motorists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching persons carrying a white cane, the Congress by a joint resolution approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized the President to issue annually a proclamation designating October 15 as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1966, as White Cane Safety Day.
I urge civic and service organizations, schools, public bodies, and the media of public information in every community to join in observing White Cane Safety Day with activities which will promote greater awareness of the significance of the white cane and thereby contribute to the safety and welfare of our blind persons.
I call upon all our citizens to join individually in this observance, that blind persons in our society may continue to enjoy the greatest possible measure of personal independence.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Secretary of State
