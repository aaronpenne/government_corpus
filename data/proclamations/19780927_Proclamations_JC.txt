By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The interdependence of farms and cities is one of the basic strengths of the Nation. 
Farm people and city people have long been partners in economic and social progress. Their partnership in the use of land, labor and capital is essential if this country is to have a continuing and adequate supply of safe, wholesome food and an abundance of goods and services and reasonable prices. 
To achieve a better mutual understanding of the interdependence that farm and city people bring to one another, and for the strength, well-being and benefit of all Americans, our Nation has traditionally set aside one week in November as Farm-City Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period November 17 through November 23, 1978, as National Farm-City Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
