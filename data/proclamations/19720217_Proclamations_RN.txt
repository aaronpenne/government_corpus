A Proclamation
 
Honorable character, good mentality, creditable achievement, and commendable attitudeâ€”these are the qualifications of more than one hundred thousand Beta Club members who are in junior and senior high school now learning the first lessons of leadership for tomorrow.
To call attention to the achievements of the Beta Club, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 153, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week which begins on the first Sunday in March 1972 as National Beta Club Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning Sunday, March 5, 1972, as National Beta Club Week, and I call upon all our citizens to encourage the Beta Club in its efforts to promote the ideals of honesty, service, and leadership among the junior and senior high school students of America.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
