By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Women's History Month is a time for us to recognize and salute women's contributions to the American family and to society. Women have been making these contributions since this continent was explored and settled and America won its independence. 
Women continue to strengthen the family and enrich our lives with intellectual gifts, creative talents, and an indomitable spirit-in business, government, volunteer activities, religious life, education, health, the military, sports, the arts, and many other areas. Historians will record the accomplishments of women at home as well, chronicling the tremendous contributions countless women have made by helping to raise children who adhere to the moral, ethical, civic, and patriotic principles that have made us, and kept us, a great country. We should be proud and grateful as we celebrate Women's History Month. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 262, has designated the month of March 1988 as "Women's History Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 1988 as Women's History Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
