A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the future of our Nation rests with the children of today;
And Whereas
, the good health and protection of childhood is fundamental to national welfare and the march forward of our country must be upon the feet of our children;
And Whereas
, a joint resolution of Congress authorizes and requests the President of the United States to proclaim annually May first as Child Health Day;
Now, Therefore, I, Herbert Hoover,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate May first, of this year, as Child Health Day and do invite the people of the United States and all agencies and organizations interested in this most important subject to make every reasonable effort to bring about a nation-wide understanding of the fundamental significance of healthy childhood, and of the importance of the conservation of the health and physical vigor of our boys and girls throughout every day of the year.
In Testimony Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-third.
