A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 15, 1959, marks the one hundred and sixty-eighth anniversary of the adoption of our Bill of Rights, the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and
Whereas
 December 10, 1959, marks the eleventh anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
Whereas
 the individual rights and freedoms set forth in the Bill of Rights constitute a vital part of the political heritage of each American citizen; and
Whereas

Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of December 10 to December 17, 1959, as Human Rights Week, and I call upon the citizens of the United States to observe these anniversaries by studying the Bill of Rights of the United States and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, that we may grow in our understanding of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of each member of the human family. In gratitude for the liberties that we enjoy, let us work to advance universal freedom and justice and stand ready to uphold the rights of others which are inextricably linked with our own.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
