By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 in the first year of our national independence, on June 14, 1777, "the United States in Congress assembled" created the flag of the United States consisting of thirteen stripes of red and white and a union of thirteen white stars in a blue field; and
Whereas
 the stars of the union, representing the States of the Nation, have multiplied with the passing years until they will number fifty on July 4, 1960; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that the sight of our flag should stir our hearts with pride and gratitude for our national heritage of independence, union, and equality under representative government dedicated to freedom and justice for all; and
Whereas
 it is proper on the birthday of the Stars and Stripes that we should recall the qualities of greatness that our Founding Fathers displayed when, with firm reliance on Divine Providence, they pledged their lives, their fortunes, and their sacred honor to bring this Nation into being; and
Whereas
 the troubled times in which we live call for the courage, steadfastness, and wisdom of our forefathers in their times of trial and for renewed dedication to our country under the banner which symbolizes our national purposes; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon the Government and the people of the United States to observe that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, June 14, 1960, to be Flag Day; and I call upon the responsible officers of the Federal Government and of the State and local governments to arrange for the flag to be flown on all public buildings on that day.
I request the people of the United States to observe Flag Day by flying the colors at their homes and other suitable places, by organizing and participating in appropriate services and ceremonies, and by giving grateful thought to the treasured national heritage which the flag represents.
I also urge all our people at all times to cultivate and to inculcate in their children the ideals and the qualities of responsible American citizenship, which constitute the strongest possible guarantee of the flag's future honor and glory.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
