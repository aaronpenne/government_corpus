By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Heading 9904.20.20 of the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) provides that no more than 775,189 kilograms of peanuts described therein may be entered into the United States during any 12-month period beginning August 1 in any year. This limitation was proclaimed by the President in Proclamation No. 3019 of June 8, 1953 (18 FR 3361), and was modified in subsequent proclamations, under the authority of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (the 1933 Act) (7 U.S.C. 624). 
2. On the basis of the investigation and report of the United States International Trade Commission, which conducted an investigation into this matter pursuant to section 22 of the 1933 Act, I find and declare that changed circumstances require a quantity of 100 million pounds (45,359,702 kilograms) of peanuts to be permitted entry during the quota period ending July 31, 1991, as hereinafter proclaimed, to carry out the purposes of section 22. I also find and declare that the entry of such quantities of peanuts, under the conditions hereinafter proclaimed, will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program of the Department of Agriculture with respect to peanuts. 
3. Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2483), requires the President, from time to time, as appropriate, to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions taken thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any import restriction. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 22 of the 1933 Act and section 604 of the Trade Act, do hereby proclaim: 
(1) In order to modify temporarily the import quota on peanuts of the type described in HTS heading 9904.20.20 and to facilitate its administration: 
(a) Heading 9904.20.20 of the HTS is modified by striking out the quota quantity "775,189" and by inserting in lieu thereof "45,359,702"; and 
(b) The following new note 5 is added to the U.S. Notes to subchapter IV of chapter 99 of the HTS: 
"5. Peanuts. -- 
No peanuts provided for in heading 9904.20.20, other than peanuts blanched or otherwise prepared or preserved, shall be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, through July 31, 1991, unless the following certificates (or a bond for their production) for such peanuts are filed with the appropriate customs officer at the time of such entry or withdrawal: 
(a) A certificate issued by the U.S. Department of Agriculture attesting to the fact that the peanuts meet the requirements as to quality, size, and wholesomeness that are specified in the Outgoing Quality Regulation -- 1990 Crop Peanuts (7 CFR 998.200), and 
(b) A certificate issued by a U.S. Department of Agriculture laboratory or a designated laboratory approved by the Peanut Administrative Committee attesting to the fact that the peanuts tested `negative' as to aflatoxin.". 
(2) In order to restore the previous quota quantity for such peanuts, HTS heading 9904.20.20 is modified by striking out the quota quantity "45,359,702" and by inserting in lieu thereof "775,189", and U.S. note 5 to subchapter IV of chapter 99 of the HTS is deleted. 
(3)(a) The modifications made by paragraph (1) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register. 
(b) The modifications made by paragraph (2) of this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after August 1, 1991. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
