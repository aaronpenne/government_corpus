A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Congress of the United States did by an act approved on the twentieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and ten, authorize the people of the territory of New Mexico to form a constitution and state government, and provide for the admission of such state into the union on an equal footing with the original states upon certain conditions in said act specified: 
And Whereas,
 said people did adopt a constitution and ask admission into the union: 
And Whereas,
 the Congress of the United States did pass a joint resolution, which was approved on the twenty-first day of August, one thousand nine hundred and eleven, for the admission of the state of New Mexico into the union, which resolution required that the lectors of New Mexico should vote upon an amendment of their state constitution, which was proposed and set forth at length in said resolution of Congress, as a condition precedent to the admission of said state, and that they should so vote at the same time that the first general election as provided for in the said constitution should be held: 
And Whereas,
 it appears from information laid before me that said first general state election was held on the seventh day of November, one thousand nine hundred and eleven, and that the returns of said election upon said amendment were made and canvassed as in Section Five of said resolution of congress provided: 
And Whereas,
 the governor of New Mexico has certified to me the result of said election upon said amendment and of the said general election: 
And Whereas,
 the conditions imposed by the said act of Congress approved on the twentieth day of June, one thousand nine hundred and ten, and by the said joint resolution of congress have been fully complied with: 
Now, Therefore, I, William Howard Taft,
 President of the United States of America, do, in accordance with the provisions of the act of Congress and the joint resolution of Congress herein named, declare and proclaim the fact that the fundamental conditions imposed by congress on the state of New Mexico to entitle that state to admission have been ratified and accepted, and that the admission of the state into the union on an equal footing with the other states is now complete. 
In Testimony Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the city of Washington this sixth day of January, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twelve and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and thirty-sixth. 
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT
