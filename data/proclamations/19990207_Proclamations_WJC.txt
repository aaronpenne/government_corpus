By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Today the world mourns one of its great leaders. A man of principle, a powerful force for good, His Majesty King Hussein was the embodiment of courage, dignity, and wisdom. Steadfast in his support for Middle East peace, he was admired by Americans and beloved by his country. King Hussein was an extraordinary statesman and a true friend of the United States.
As a mark of respect for the memory of King Hussein, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff during this same period at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-third.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
