By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Today's fathers face new challenges as America changes. In addition to their traditional role as breadwinner for the family, many fathers are playing a greater role in raising children and in the home. The preservation of America's family structure will, in large measure, depend upon their ability to meet these demands. 
To honor our Nation's fathers, and to provide an opportunity to reflect upon their contributions to our society, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 24, 1972 (86 Stat. 124; 36 U.S.C. 142a), has asked the President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon the American people to observe the third Sunday in June of each year as Father's Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, June 18, 1978, be observed as Father's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
