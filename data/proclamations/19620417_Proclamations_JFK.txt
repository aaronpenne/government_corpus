A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument in the State of New Mexico, established by Proclamation No. 781 of November 16, 1907, was reserved and set apart for its scientific and educational interest, being the best representation of the Cliff Dwellerâ€™s remains of that region; and 
Whereas
 approximately three hundred and seventy-fire acres of land near the present boundaries of the monument, under the jurisdiction of the Forest Service, Department of Agriculture, contain additional cliff dwellings and pit-house sites which are needed to round out the interpretive story of the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument; and 
Whereas
 it appears that the public interest would be promoted by adding to Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument these lands now within the Gila National Forest; and 
Whereas
 these lands are essential for the proper care, management, protection, interpretation, and preservation of the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of Congress approved June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C. 431) do hereby proclaim that, subject to any valid interest or rights, the following described tract of land, which comprises the original site of the monument and the additional lands needed for the purposes stated above, shall constitute the Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument:
