A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 American mothers have ever nurtured the ideals which foster and enrich a true democracy; and
Whereas
 it is a cherished American custom to dedicate one day each year to expressions of affection for our own mothers and for all mothers of the Nation; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), gave formal recognition to that custom by designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day and paid tribute to the contribution made by American mothers to the home and the community:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request the observance of Sunday, May 9, 1948, as Mother's Day, and I direct the officials of the Government to display the flag on all Government buildings on that day. I also call upon the people of the United States to give public and private expression to the esteem in which our country holds its mothers through the display of the flag at their homes and other suitable places, through prayers at their places of worship, and through appropriate manifestations of honor, devotion, and love.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 20th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United states of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
