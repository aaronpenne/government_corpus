A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Army Air Forces contributed immeasurably to our victory over the enemy in Europe and Asia, and stands ever ready to defend our nation in time of danger; and
Whereas
 our appreciation of liberty is strengthened by our recollection of the achievements of the living and the sacrifices of the dead, which through four decades have nurtured the growth of American air power; and
Whereas
 August 1, 1947, marks the fortieth anniversary of the birth of the Army Air Forces:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in order that we may more justly honor the men and women of the Army Air Forces and more fully acknowledge the contributions of all those who have developed and maintained our nation's air strength, do hereby proclaim Friday, August 1, 1947, as Air Force Day, and invite the Governors of all the States to issue proclamations calling for the observance of that day; and I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on that day.
I remind all of our citizens that the air power of the nation is essential to the preservation of our liberty, and that the continued development of the science of air transportation is vital to the trade and commerce of a peaceful world.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 10th day of July in the year nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
