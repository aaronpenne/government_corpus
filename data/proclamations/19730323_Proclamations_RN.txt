By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The meaning of America is rooted deep in the brains and bones of men and women who once cherished a dream that mankind might live in freedom somehow, somewhere on this earth. The dream became an idea, the idea an ideal, and the ideal a reality here in this land. Brighter than the sun, the meaning of America shines across the world, warming those to whom the dignity of living in liberty is still a dream.
Generations of men and women "who more than self their country loved" have given all that liberty demanded to keep the meaning of America alive, both in our land and in the hearts of others abroad. This willingness to give is the measure of our loyalty—it is reflected in how we live our liberty, and how we love our country.
On this Loyalty Day, let us reaffirm our commitment to the great work which began long ago, but which is still unfinished as our Nation is unfinished—to make whole and perfect the meaning of America: "that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness."
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of the Congress of July 18, 1958, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic and educational organizations to observe Tuesday, May 1, 1973 as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in which all may join.
I call also upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as an expression of our loyalty to the Nation symbolized by that flag.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
