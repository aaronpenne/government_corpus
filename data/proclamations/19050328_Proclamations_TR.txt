By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Madison Forest Reserve, in the State of Montana, was established by proclamation dated August sixteenth, nineteen hundred and two, under and by virtue of section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," which provides, "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas,
 it is further provided by the Act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes", that "The President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve";
And Whereas,
 it appears that the public good would be promoted by releasing and excluding certain lands from the said forest reserve;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, do hereby make known and proclaim that the boundary lines of the aforesaid Madison Forest Reserve are hereby modified so as to read as follows:
Beginning at the point where the western boundary of the Yellowstone National Park intersects the boundary line between the States of Montana and Idaho; thence in a general north-westerly and southwesterly direction along said state boundary line to its intersection with the range line between Ranges one (1) and two (2) East; thence northerly to the south-east corner of Township thirteen (13) South, Range one (1) East; thence westerly to the south-west corner of said township; thence northerly to the south-east corner of Township twelve (12) South, Range one (1) West; thence westerly to the south-east corner of Township twelve (12) South, Range six (6) West; thence northerly to the north-east corner of said township; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Township twelve (12) South, Range five (5) West; thence northerly, allowing for the proper offset on the Second (2nd) Standard Parallel South, to the north-west corner of Township ten (10) South, Range four (4) West; thence easterly to the south-east corner of Section thirty-three (33), Township nine (9) South, Range four (4) West; thence northerly to the north-west corner of Section fifteen (15), said township; thence easterly to the south-east corner of Section twelve (12), said township; thence northerly to the northwest corner of Section thirty (30), Township seven (7) South, Range three (3) West; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section twenty-seven (27), said township; thence southerly to the south-east corner of said section; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section thirty-six (36), said township; thence southerly to the southeast corner of said township; thence easterly to the north-west corner of Township eight (8) South, Range one (1) West; thence southerly to the south-west corner of said township; thence easterly to the south-east corner of said township; thence southerly along the Principal Meridian to its intersection with the Second (2nd) Standard Parallel South; thence easterly along said parallel to its intersection with the western boundary of the Yellowstone National Park; thence southerly along the western boundary of said park to its intersection with the boundary line between the States of Montana and Idaho, the place of beginning; such of the above-named corners as have not been established by the official surveys being intended to be located at the points where such corners would fall in projecting the surveys in the directions indicated without allowing for any irregularities which may occur in actually extending the surveys.
The lands hereby excluded from the reserve and restored to the public domain shall be open to settlement from the date hereof, but shall not be subject to entry, filing or selection until after ninety days' notice by such publication as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 28th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-ninth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
By the President:
ALVEY A. ADEE,
 Acting Secretary of State.
