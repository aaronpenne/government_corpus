By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Most Americans today are striving to build a better world, where men can live in peace and share the benefits derived from modern advances in science and technology. To the extent that we succeed in this effort, we will pass on to our children a brighter future as individuals, as families, and as a nation.
But the health of some of our children will prevent them from sharing fully in this future. For examples, more than ten million children need eye care; more than two and a half million have speech impairments; more than two million do not hear well; nearly two million have orthopedic handicaps. Their future will only be as bright as we, the leaders of this generation, are able to make it by minimizing physical impairments or other handicaps to their health.
In recognition of the necessity for protecting and developing the health of the Nation's children, the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October of each year as Child Health Day.
Child Health Day is also an appropriate time to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund are doing to improve the health of children around the world.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 6, 1969, as Child Health Day, and call upon all our citizens to unite on that day to make plans for the health needs of our children, whether they live in the cities or in the small towns or on the farms of rural America.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
