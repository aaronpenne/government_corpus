A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the future of our Nation depends in great measure on the healthy growth and development of our children; and
Whereas
 the progress of science has given us new opportunities to fulfill our responsibilities as parents and adult citizens concerned for the well-being of the coming generation; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day is also a fitting time for the people of the United States to observe a Universal Children's Day, as recommended by a resolution of the United Nations General Assembly, and to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund, are doing to build better health for the children of mankind:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, the first day of May 1959, as Child Health Day, and I invite all citizens to reassess on that day the ways to provide full opportunities for the healthy growth and development of our young people.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twentieth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
