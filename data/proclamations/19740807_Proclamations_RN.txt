By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
One of the foundation blocks in the American democracy is the civic responsibility which every American accepts as part of his heritage and his obligation to his country.
This responsibility—this understanding, appreciation, and involvement in our Government—begins in our Nation's educational institutions. Within these institutions our student government associations play a central role. The learning experience that students obtain as officers, members, and as voters in student government associations is vital to a clear understanding of our democratic system.
The successful functioning of student government associations reaffirms the essential truth of our democracy: that all people should have a voice in making those decisions that affect their lives. Student government provides this voice for our Nation's students in educational institutions.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 29, 1974, as National Student Government Day. I invite the Governors of the States and of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and other officials at the local level to issue similar proclamations.
I also urge all educational institutions to join in appropriate activities to highlight the importance of student government and to encourage wide participation in its activities. I further urge all students in our country to acquaint themselves fully with their own student government associations and to play a constructive role in contributing to their success.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.
RICHARD NIXON
