By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
One hundred and ninety years ago, a young Polish patriot in exile gave his life in the cause of American freedom and independence.
Count Casimir Pulaski came to America and joined the Continental Army. He fought with great valor and was promoted by the Congress to the rank of brigadier general in recognition of his military leadership at the Battle of Brandywine. He raised and commanded a cavalry unit which won fame as the Pulaski Legion.
On October 11, 1779, General Pulaski died of wounds received two days earlier while leading a cavalry charge in the Battle of Savannah.
It is fitting that on the anniversary of his death we pay grateful tribute to this gallant Pole, and to the millions of his countrymen in America who have contributed to this nation's growth and to the defense of its freedoms.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 11, 1969, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
