By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Bowling is the largest indoor participation sport in the United States. Some 70 million Americans take part each year, and millions more enjoy this exciting sport on television. Bowling is an excellent form of exercise and recreation for all people regardless of age. 
Bowling is one of the oldest sports in the world. People have competed in some form of bowling for thousands of years. Today, many different forms of bowling are played in many cultures throughout the world. 
Bowling has long been part of American life. Many immigrants brought different forms of bowling from their homelands. The popularity of the legend of Rip van Winkle shows that bowling has been part of our society since the birth of our country.
The Congress, by Public Law 99-589, has designated the week beginning January 4, 1987, as "National Bowling Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning January 4, 1987, as National Bowling Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate observances and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
