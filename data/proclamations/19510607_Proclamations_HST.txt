A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), has set aside June 14 of each year as Flag Day, in commemoration of the adoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777; and
Whereas
 this emblem has always stood for freedom and independence; and
Whereas
 these blessings were won by the American people, and have been preserved for a century and three-quarters, by courage, faith, and vigilance; and
Whereas
 in the Far East the American flag, together with that of the United Nations, is now flying alongside the flags of other countries in the same enduring struggle for freedom and independence:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Flag Day, Thursday, June 14, 1951, and I call upon the people to observe that day with special patriotic ceremonies designed to give expression to our reverence for the flag and the ideals it symbolizes.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this seventh day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
