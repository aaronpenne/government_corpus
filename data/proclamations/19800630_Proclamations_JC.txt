By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. By Proclamation 4634 of January 26, 1979, the President proclaimed, under the authority of the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 203(a) (5), (e)(3) and (g) (2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2253(a) (5), (e)(3) and (g) (2)) (the Trade Act), the implementation of the orderly marketing agreements entered into with Taiwan and with the Republic of Korea which imposed quantitative restrictions on imports from Taiwan and Korea of color television receivers and certain subassemblies thereof. The limitations applied to covered articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after February 1, 1979, and were to continue through June 30, 1980, unless earlier modified or terminated. Proclamation 4759 of May 15, 1980, modified Proclamation 4634. The limitations currently in effect, applicable to articles provided for in items 923.74 through 923.83, inclusive of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), will terminate at the close of June 30, 1980, unless extended by the President under section 203 (h) (3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (3)). 
2. On May 16, 1980, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), in accordance with sections 203(i) (3) and (5) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(i) (3) and (5)), reported the results of its investigation under section 203(i)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(i) (3)) to the President (USITC Publication 1068). The USITC advised the President that termination of the import relief currently in effect with respect to certain color television receivers and subassemblies thereof will have an adverse effect on the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products. 
3. Section 203(h)(3) and (5) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(h)(3) and (5)) provides that any import relief instituted under the authority of section 203 may be extended by the President at a level no greater than that in effect at the time of extension if the President determines, after considering the advice of the USITC and the factors indicated in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), that such extension is in the national interest. 
4. In accordance with section 203(h) (3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (3)), I have determined that the level of import relief hereinafter proclaimed extends import relief at a level no greater than that in effect for the period of February 1, 1979 through June 30, 1980, and, having considered the advice given by the USITC in its report to the President and the factors indicated in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I have determined that the extension of the orderly marketing agreements with the Coordinating Council for North American Affairs and the Republic of Korea, covering certain color television receivers and subassemblies thereof as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, is in the national interest. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me in the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and sections 4(b) (2) and 6(b) of the Taiwan Relations Act (22 U.S.C. 3303(b) (2) and 3305(b)), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat.
