A Proclamation
Skiing in the United States has now become one of our most popular sports. This active and invigorating pastime provides not only recreation, but an unsurpassed opportunity to enjoy the great scenic beauty of our majestic mountains. 
Its growing popularity has caused skiing to become of great economic importance to many areas of the United States, where our Nation has now developed some of the finest skiers, and the finest ski facilities, in the world. 
It was for this reason that the Congress, by a joint resolution approved January 21, 1966, requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period beginning January 21, 1966, and ending January 30, 1966, as National Ski Week. 
I am most happy to honor that request, and do hereby proclaim the period from January 21 through January 30, 1966, as National Ski Week. 
I call upon individual skiers, sports organizations, community leaders, and other interested citizens to arrange appropriate observances of National Ski Week and to join in the effort to improve our ski facilities and to improve the skill of the skiers representing the United States of America in international competitions. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
