By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Among this Nation's greatest treasures are the creative talents of our people and the opportunities available for them to develop their talents and thereby enhance the richness of our cultural life. In every artistic discipline, great American artists and institutions have established ever-rising standards of achievement to challenge and inspire successive generations. 
No single institution embodies this tradition of sustained artistic achievement more fully than the Metropolitan Opera, which is celebrating 100 years of extraordinary contributions to the culture of America. Legendary performances of music theater masterpieces have filled the Metropolitan Opera House in New York, halls across the country during the Company's annual tours, and millions of American homes through live radio and television broadcasts which have become part of our national tradition. The Metropolitan Opera also reaches out to discover and encourage young American talent by auditions held throughout the country, and it nurtures and develops great singers of the future. 
Through its deep involvement with artists, audiences, and patrons, and with the voluntary assistance of the members of its National Council, the Metropolitan Opera has contributed invaluably to the growth of an American opera community whose vitality and brilliance are acclaimed around the world. 
In recognition of the Metropolitan Opera's extraordinary achievements and commitment to excellence, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 128, has authorized and requested the President to designate October 22, 1983, the one hundredth anniversary of its first performance, as "Metropolitan Opera Day" throughout the United States. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate October 22, 1983, as Metropolitan Opera Day and call upon all Federal, State and local government agencies, interested groups and organizations, and the people of the United States to observe that day by engaging in appropriate programs and activities to show their support of America's rich heritage in music theater and one of its premier performing institutions. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
