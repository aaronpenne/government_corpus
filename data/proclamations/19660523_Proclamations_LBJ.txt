A Proclamation
The small businesses of America are the foundation of our cherished system of free, competitive enterprise. Our nearly five million small businesses supply more than a third of the Nation's goods and services, and are a fertile source of new ideas and new products to enrich the lives of our citizens and stimulate the growth of our economy. 
Small business concerns, which have increased by more than 300,000 during the past few years, are helping to provide the additional jobs needed by a rapidly growing Nation. 
The small, privately owned concern has played a fundamental role in the development of the American way of life, and it continues to represent the door of opportunity for millions of enterprising citizens. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 22, 1966, as Small Business Week; and I call upon chambers of commerce, boards of trade, and other public and private organizations to participate in ceremonies recognizing the contribution of small business to our prosperous society, to our welfare and happiness, and to our goal of a better and more productive life for all our people. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 23rd day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
