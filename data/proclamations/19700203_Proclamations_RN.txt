By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
For many decades the Olympic Games have contributed in a unique way to greater understanding, friendship, and mutual respect among all the peoples of the world. The XXI Olympiad of the modern era is to be held in the year 1976, a year in which the United States of America is to celebrate its Bicentennialâ€”when this Nation will be reaffirming principles that have much in common with the purposes of the Olympic Games.
The Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 131, has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue a proclamation inviting and welcoming all authorized Olympic delegations to the 1976 Olympic Games if they are to be held in the United States.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby extend the warm welcome of the United States to all authorized Olympic delegations and ask them to come to the United States to take part in the 1976 Olympic Games if they are to be held in the cities of Los Angeles and Denver; and further, I hereby pledge that the United States will take every appropriate measure to insure the entry and full participation of all authorized delegations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
