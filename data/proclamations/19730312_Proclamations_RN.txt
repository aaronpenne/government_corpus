By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The first Earth Week in 1971 marked an important milestone for the cause of environmental protection. It also provided an important opportunity for all Americans to pay tribute to the qualities which have made our country greatâ€”individual initiative, voluntary action, and a deep sense of responsibility for the gifts of nature and the welfare of the community.
Our environment is the source of life upon which we all depend; its preservation has brought out the best in the American character. In thousands of communities, citizens have joined to improve the quality of their lives and those of their neighbors.
Our environmental problems have not been resolved since that first Earth Week, but we have done much and we will do more. While our new awareness has taught us that our natural resources are exhaustible, we know that our most important resource, the American spirit, is not.
We can never rest in the effort to preserve and improve our good earth. Earth Week, 1973 gives us the chance to affirm our dedication to that high calling.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning April 8, 1973 as Earth Week. I call upon Federal, State and local officials to foster the purposes of Earth Week and to arrange for its proper observance. I ask that special attention be given to personal voluntary activities and educational efforts directed toward protecting and enhancing our life-giving environment.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 12th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
