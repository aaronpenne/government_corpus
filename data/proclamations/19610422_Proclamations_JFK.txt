A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 a fundamental aim of United States policy is the development of an international economic environment that will foster the material well-being and political independence of all free peoples; and 
Whereas
 an effective United States commercial policy in support of this aim requires a vigorous domestic economy; an expanding international commerce, and an equilibrium in our international payments; and 
Whereas
 American business is being challenged in a highly competitive international economy to strive with greater vigor to develop expanding opportunities for the sale of American products in foreign markets: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 21, 1961, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the State and local governments to cooperate in the observance of that week. 
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and to our relations with other nations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 22d day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
DEAN RUSK, 
Secretary of State.
