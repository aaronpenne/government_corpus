A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution ap­proved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), the Congress has authorized and requested the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation desig­nating the third week in July 1959 as "Captive Nations Week," and to issue a similar proclamation each year until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the cap­tive nations of the world; and 
Whereas
 many of the roots of our society and our population lie in these countries; and 
Whereas
 it is in keeping with our national tradition that the American people manifest its interest in the freedom of other nations: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 16, 1961, as Captive Nations Week. 
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to recommit themselves to the support of the just aspirations of all peoples for national independence and freedom. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fourteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
