, acting under the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, the American Red Cross and its sister societies have furnished voluntary aid to the sick and wounded of armies in time of war and have protected prisoners of war: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1964 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to honor the American Red Cross to the limit of their capability by participating in and strengthening its work.
