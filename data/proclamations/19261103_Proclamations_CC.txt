A Proclamation
Whereas
 the 11th of November, 1918, marked the cessation of the most destructive, sanguinary, and far-reaching war in human annals; and
Whereas it is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this date should be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer and exercises designed to perpetuate peace through good will and mutual understanding between nations; and
Whereas,
 by a concurrent resolution, passed by the Senate on May 25, 1926, and by the House of Representatives on June 4, 1926, the President was requested to issue a proclamation "calling upon the officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11th, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches or other places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with all other peoples":
Now, Therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the said concurrent resolution, do hereby order that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on November 11,1926, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with all other peoples.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the United States.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 3d day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, and of the Independence of the United States, the one hundred and fifty-first.
