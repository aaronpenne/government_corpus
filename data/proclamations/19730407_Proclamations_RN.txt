By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Eighty-three years ago the International Union of American Republics was established, the forerunner of the Organization of American States. There have been differences among the member nations in those eighty-three years, and some of these differences continue today. But far more significant is the fact that, despite dramatic changes and our great cultural and political diversity, the members of the hemispheric community have maintained and strengthened our common forum in a general climate of friendship and understanding.
It is an intangible force which forms the basis of solidarity among the Americasâ€”a combination of idealism and realism and a capacity to grow and adjust with the times. The Organization of American States is the focal point of this force, a place where cooperation rather than confrontation strengthens the common ties shared by the nations of the hemisphere.
This unity of the Americas is based on respect for the historic personality of each of the countries of the Americas and demands a mutual understanding and respect for each country.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, April 14, 1973, as Pan American Day, and the week beginning April 8 and ending April 14 as Pan American Week, and I call upon the Governors of the fifty States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
