A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States by the act approved on July 7, 1958 (72 Stat. 339), accepted, ratified, and confirmed the constitution adopted by a vote of the people of Alaska in an election held on April 24, 1956, and provided for the admission of the State of Alaska into the Union on an equal footing with the other States of the Union upon compliance with certain procedural requirements specified in that act; and 
Whereas
 it appears from information before me that a majority of the legal votes cast at an election held on August 26, 1958, were in favor of each of the propositions required to be submitted to the people of Alaska by section 8 (b) of the act of July 7, 1958; and 
Whereas
 it further appears from information before me that a general election was held on November 25, 1958, and that the returns of the general election were made and certified as provided in the act of July 7, 1958; and 
Whereas
 the Acting Governor of Alaska has certified to me the results of the submission to the people of Alaska of the three propositions set forth in section 8 (b) of the act of July 7, 1958, and the results of the general election; and 
Whereas
 I find and announce that the people of Alaska have duly adopted the propositions required to be submitted to them by the act of July 7, 1958, and have duly elected the officers required to be elected by that act: 
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the procedural requirements imposed by the Congress on the State of Alaska to entitle that State to admission into the Union have been complied with in all respects and that admission of the State of Alaska into the Union on an equal footing with the other States of the Union is now accomplished. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington at one minute past noon on this third day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
