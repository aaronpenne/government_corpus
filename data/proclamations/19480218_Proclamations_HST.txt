A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the American National Red Cross, in accordance with the provisions of its federal charter, continues to give succor to victims of disaster, to render special services to our armed forces, and in many other ways to contribute to the health, safety, and welfare of our people; and 
Whereas
 in 1947 the Red Cross expended a sum in excess of $11,000,000 on account of disasters alone, aiding the victims of the greatest number of calamities in any single year of the organization's history; and
Whereas
 in response to a growing need, recognized by numerous medical leaders, the Red Cross has now embarked upon a national blood-donor program, designed eventually to furnish whole blood and blood derivatives to the entire Nation without cost therefor; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross must stand ready to provide assistance to millions of American war veterans in their readjustment to civilian life and to furnish added comfort, entertainment, and relaxation to those in Government hospitals; and
Whereas
 this organization, which exemplifies the noblest instinct of mankind - the desire to aid one's fellow man - is now issuing its 1948 appeal for contributions totaling $75,000,000:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American national Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1948 as Red Cross Month; and I urge every citizen to respond as generously as possible to this humanitarian cause.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN

G. C. MARSHALL,
