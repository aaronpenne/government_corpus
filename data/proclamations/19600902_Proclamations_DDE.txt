A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 6, 1960, will mark the centennial of the birth of Jane Addams, one of our country's first and greatest champions of human progress through neighborly understanding; and
Whereas
 Jane Addams pioneered in helping unfortunate persons through the neighborly services offered at Hull House—the Nation's first settlement house—which she founded in Chicago in 1889; and
Whereas
 many of today's welfare services owe their origin to her establishment of such resources as our first child-guidance clinic, a child-care center to help working mothers, an employment service, and educational and recreational opportunities for impoverished families; and
Whereas
 her vision and leadership led to the outlawing of child labor, to the establishment of the world's first juvenile court, and to improved working conditions and hours of labor; and
Whereas
 she fought to improve sanitary standards in the Nation's homes and market places and to effect clearance of slums; and
Whereas
 her work at Hull House and her leadership in the struggles for woman suffrage, race equality, and international cooperation have benefited the people of other lands as well as the people of the United States; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved September 2, 1960, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim September 6, 1960, as a day upon which all Americans should pay honor and respect to Jane Addams, founder and leader of Chicago's Hull House:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate September 6, 1960, as Jane Addams Centennial Day; and I urge all Americans to rededicate themselves on that day, and throughout this centennial year of 1960, to the ideals that motivated Jane Addams in her devotion to the work of improving individual, family, and community welfare.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
