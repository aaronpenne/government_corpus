A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the XVIIth Olympic Games of the modern era will be held in Rome, Italy, from August 25 to September 11, 1960, and the Winter Games will be held at Squaw Valley, California, from February 18 to February 28, 1960; and
Whereas
 these games unite in friendly competition athletes from around the world, each governed by the traditional rules of sportsmanship and eager to gain honor for the country he represents; and
Whereas
 in these challenging times mankind stands in need of occasions which bring out the finest efforts of the human spirit, of physical skill and endurance, and of achievements of individuals rather than of governments; and
Whereas
 the Olympic Games uniquely provide such occasions and contribute much to the areas of common understanding and mutual respect among all peoples; and
Whereas
 the United States Olympic Association is now engaged in seeking broad popular support for the young men and women representing the United States at these athletic events; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved September 22, 1959, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period of October 17 to October 24, 1959, as National Olympic Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period of October 17 to October 24, 1959, as National Olympic Week; and I ask and urge all our citizens to give full support to the planning for the XVIIth Olympic Games and the Olympic Winter Games of 1960 so that the United States will be able to send to these games a truly representative team.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
