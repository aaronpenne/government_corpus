By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Arches National Monument in Utah was established by Proclamation No. 1875 of April 12, 1929, and enlarged by Proclamation No. 2312 of November 25, 1938, and its boundary adjusted by Proclamation No. 3360 of July 22, 1960, to reserve and set apart areas containing extraordinary examples of wind-eroded sandstone formations and other features of geological, historic and scientific interest; and
Whereas,
 it would be in the public interest to add to the Arches National Monument certain adjoining lands which encompass a variety of additional features which constitute objects of geological and scientific interest to complete the geologic story presented at the monument; and
Whereas,
 under section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225, 16 U.S.C. 431), the President is authorized "to declare by public proclamation * * * objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected:"
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States, under the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, supra, do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, (1) the lands owned or controlled by the United States within the exterior boundaries of the following described area are hereby added to and made a part of the Arches National Monument, and (2) the State-owned and privately owned lands within those boundaries shall become and be reserved as parts of that monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
