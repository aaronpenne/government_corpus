By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Compassion is one of our Nation's defining values, and we must work to ensure that all Americans are able to participate fully in society. The white cane allows many of our citizens who are blind or visually impaired to enjoy increased mobility. On White Cane Safety Day, we celebrate the symbolism of the white cane and highlight the importance of ensuring that individuals who are blind or visually impaired can live independently and realize their full potential. 
Through the New Freedom Initiative, my Administration has put into action our strong commitment to helping more individuals with disabilities participate in all aspects of life. Since 2001, this initiative has built on the progress of the Americans with Disabilities Act and helped create greater access to schools, the workplace, and community life. These efforts are helping to remove barriers and enabling more Americans to live with greater dignity and freedom. 
The Congress, by joint resolution approved on October 6, 1964 (Public Law 88-628), as amended, has designated October 15 of each year as "White Cane Safety Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, George W. Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 2008, as White Cane Safety Day. I call upon public officials, business leaders, educators, librarians, and all the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirty-third. 
GEORGE W. BUSH
