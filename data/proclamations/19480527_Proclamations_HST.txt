A Proclamation
Whereas
 by the act of Congress approved July 17, 1946, 60 Stat. 568, the President is authorized, under the conditions prescribed in that act, to grant an extension of time for the fulfillment of the conditions and formalities for the renewal of trade-mark registrations prescribed by section 12 of the act authorizing the registration of trade-marks used in commerce with foreign nations or among the several States or with Indian tribes, and to protect the same, approved February 20, 1905, as amended (15 U.S.C. 92), by nationals of countries which accord substantially equal treatment in this respect to citizens of the United States of America:
Whereas
 the Southwestern Monuments Association, an organization created for the purpose of fostering the development and preservation of the group of areas known as the Southwestern national Monuments, which include the Aztec Ruins National Monument, has donated the said tract of land to the United States for addition to such monument; and
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such tract of land as an additional to the said Aztec Ruins National Monument:
