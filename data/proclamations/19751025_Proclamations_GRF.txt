By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Country music-that uniquely American art form-holds a special place in our society. Its stories of struggle, of patience, of patriotism, of love won and lost-all set to music as distinctive and eloquently simple as any in the world-give pleasure and inspiration to millions of Americans. 
Because country music plays such a significant role in American life, because its stars and its fans alike represent the very heart of America, it is particularly fitting that we as a Nation pay tribute to this very special kind of music. In doing so, we honor the hundreds of talented people who make that music, and the millions more who enjoy it. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, designate October 1975 as Country Music Month, and encourage all Americans to commemorate this designation with suitable observances. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
