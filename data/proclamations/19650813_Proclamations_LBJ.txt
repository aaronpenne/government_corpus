A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the intrepid seafarer, Leif Erikson, and his dauntless crew of Vikings sailed across uncharted seas to explore the shores of North America, opening the way to a new world bountifully endowed for millions who would later seek there a new life; and
Whereas
 recent archeological discoveries in Newfoundland attest to the coming of the hardy Norse seafarers to these shores almost a thousand years ago; and
Whereas
 Leif Erikson, a pathfinder in the stirring period of Norse colonization and discovery, is of 'special significance and inspiration to the ten million Americans of Scandinavian descent; and
Whereas
 it IS particularly fitting to give national recognition to this bold explorer today, when men of similar courage and resourcefulness are challenging the equally formidable unknowns of our own times; and
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), authorized the President to proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 9, 1965, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to. display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this twelfth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Secretary of State
