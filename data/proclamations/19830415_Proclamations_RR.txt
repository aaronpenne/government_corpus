By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 201(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2251(d)(1)), as amended, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) on February 1, 1983, reported to the President the results of its Investigation No. TA-201-47 under section 201(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251(b)). The USITC determined that motorcycles having engines with total piston displacement over 700 cubic centimeters, provided for in item 692.50 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of the threat of serious injury to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. The USITC recommended the imposition of additional ad valorem duties on imports of such motorcycles of: 45 percent in the first year, 35 percent in the second year, 20 percent in the third year, 15 percent in the fourth year, and 10 percent in the fifth year. 
2. On April 1, 1983, pursuant to section 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I determined to impose the additional duties recommended by the USITC, but with tariff-rate quotas to assure small volume producers which have not contributed to the threat of injury continued access to the United States market. In order to treat Japan fairly, I determined to provide a tariff-rate quota also for articles from Japan. On April 1, 1983, in accordance with section 203(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(b)(1)), I transmitted a report to the Congress setting forth the action I determined to take and the reason it differed from the action recommended by the USITC. 
3. Section 503(c)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(2)) provides that no article shall be an eligible article for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for any period during which such article is the subject of any action proclaimed pursuant to section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253). 
4. Section 203(e)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)) requires that import relief be proclaimed and take effect within 15 days after the import relief determination date. 
5. Pursuant to sections 203(a)(1), 203(e)(1), and 503(c)(2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1), 2253(e)(1), and 2463(c)(2)), I am providing import relief through the temporary increase of import duties imposed in the form of tariff-rate quotas, and the suspension of GSP treatment, on certain motorcycles, as hereinafter proclaimed. 
Now,, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including General Headnote 4 of the TSUS, sections 203, 503, and 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253, 2463, and 2483), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), do proclaim that- 
(1) Part I of Schedule XX to the GATT is modified to conform to the action taken in Annex I to this proclamation. 
(2) Subpart B, part 6 of schedule 6 and subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS are modified as set forth in Annex I to this proclamation. 
(3)(a) Annex II of Executive Order No. 11888 of November 24, 1975, as amended, listing articles that are eligible for benefits of the GSP when imported from any designated beneficiary developing country, is amended by deleting item 692.50 and substituting item 692.53, as added by Annex I to this proclamation, in lieu thereof. 
(b) In order to restore GSP treatment for the motorcycles subject to import relief, Annex II of Executive Order No. 11888 of November 24, 1975, as amended, is further amended by inserting in numerical sequence item 692.52, as added by Annex I of this proclamation, effective upon the termination of the import relief proclaimed herein or of any period of extension of such relief. 
(4) In order to provide staged reductions in the rates of duty for those new TSUS items created by Annex I(b) to this proclamation, Annex III to Presidential Proclamation 4707 of December 11, 1979, as amended, is further amended by Annex II to this proclamation, attached hereto and made a part thereof. 
(5) Whenever the column 1 rate of duty in the TSUS for any item specified in Annex I(b) to this proclamation is reduced to the same level as, or to a lower level than, the corresponding rate of duty inserted in the column entitled "LDDC" by Annex I(b) of this proclamation, the rate of duty in the column entitled "LDDC" for such item shall be deleted from the TSUS. 
(6) With the exception of paragraph (3)(b), this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after April 16, 1983, and before the close of April 15, 1988, unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly modified or terminated. 
(7) The Commissioner of Customs shall take such action as the United States Trade Representative shall direct in the implementation and administration of the import relief herein proclaimed. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 15th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
