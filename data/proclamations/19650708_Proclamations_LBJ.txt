A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the year 1965 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly as International Cooperation Year, and I have so proclaimed it for the United States; and 
Whereas
 international cooperation is essential to the achievement of a peaceful world order; and 
Whereas
 the foundation for the peace of mankind within nations and among nations is a system of law and legal institutions; and 
Whereas
 a system of law enables men and nations to avoid conflict, and legal institutions provide forums for the peaceful resolution of conflicts when they arise; and 
Whereas
 the expansion of the Rule of Law in the World Community requires broad agreement on principles and terminology for multilateral treaties and conventions; and 
Whereas
 those treaties require public support for the promise and potential of a world ruled by law; and 
Whereas
 it is essential that the minds and hearts of men of good will of all nations be focused upon the necessity of world peace through law: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, believing that cooperation to build a world legal system is among the most beneficial projects that can be advanced by International Cooperation Year and in order to further the great objectives thus noted for achieving world peace, do hereby proclaim September 13, 1965, as World Law Day and call upon all public and private officials, members of the legal profession, citizens, and all men of good will to arrange appropriate observances and ceremonies in courts, schools, and universities, and other public places. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
