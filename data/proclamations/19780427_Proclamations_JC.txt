By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Throughout the remainder of our third century of national existence, America will face problems that will differ markedly from those we have confronted in the past. Yet some things will remain constant. Among these is the loyalty of the American people. 
Because we are a free people, the loyalty we feel to our country is deeper than that which any imposed political or ideological orthodoxy could possibly evoke. And as long as we continue to remain faithful to the principles and freedoms on which our republic was founded, that loyalty will see us through whatever challenges lie ahead. 
To encourage the people of the United States to reflect upon the liberties and institutions that have inspired the loyalty of so many generations of Americans, the Congress, by joint resolution of July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369; 36 U.S.C. 162) has designated the first day of May of each year as Loyalty Day and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, call upon all Americans to observe Monday, May 1, 1978, as Loyalty Day. I ask the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on that day on all Government buildings. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
