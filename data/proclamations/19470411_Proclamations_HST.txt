A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is a felicitous American custom to turn our thoughts anew to the commemoration of motherhood on one day in each year; and
Whereas
, in recognition of that custom, Public Resolution 25, 63d Congress, approved May 8, 1914, provides that the second Sunday in May of each year shall be designated as Mother's Day, and authorizes and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling for the public observance of that day; and
Whereas
, in the eloquent words of the resolution, "the service rendered the United States by the American mother is the greatest source of the country's strength and inspiration";
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, hereby direct the officials of the Government to display the flag on all Government buildings on Mother's Day, May 11, 1947, and I call upon the people of the United States to display the flag on that day in their homes and other suitable places and to manifest through private and public expressions the reverent esteem in which we hold the mothers of our country.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 11th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
