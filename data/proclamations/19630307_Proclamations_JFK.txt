A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the conquest of cancer, which has annually claimed the lives of 280,000 Americans and threatens the lives of millions more in the future, depends upon vigorous programs of medical research and public education; and 
Whereas
 progress in research has already significantly increased the rate of survival of cancer patients and holds promise of further improvement through studies dealing with the cause, prevention, and treatment of malignant disease; and 
Whereas
 the continued efforts of medical scientists, physicians, public health workers, and volunteers depend upon continued public support, encouragement, and cooperation; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April as Cancer Control Month: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1963 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
I also ask the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all other interested persons and groups to unite during the appointed month in public reaffirmation of this Nation's efforts to control cancer. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
