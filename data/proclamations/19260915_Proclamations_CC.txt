That whenever the President finds that in any American country, or in any country in which the United States exercises extraterritorial jurisdiction, conditions of domestic violence exist, which are or may be promoted by the use of arms or munitions of war procured from the United States, and makes proclamation thereof, it shall be unlawful to export, except under such limitations and exceptions as the President prescribes, any arms or munitions of war from any place in the United States to such country until otherwise ordered by the President or by Congress.
And Whereas,

And
 I do hereby enjoin upon all officers of the United States, charged with the execution of the laws thereof, the utmost diligence in preventing violations of the said Joint Resolution and this my Proclamation issued thereunder, and in bringing to trial and punishment any offenders against the same.
And
 I do hereby delegate to the Secretary of State the power of prescribing exceptions and limitations to the application of the said Joint Resolution of January 31, 1922, as made effective by this my Proclamation issued thereunder.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 15th day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-first.
