A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the world has suffered a grievous loss in the untimely death of Dag Hammarskjold; and 
Whereas
 this eminent statesman was a leader in the eternal struggle of man to achieve a peaceful world; and 
Whereas
, as Secretary General of the United Nations since 1953, by his courage, his wisdom, his statesmanship, and his personal dedication to the fulfillment of the never-ceasing quest for peace and justice, he earned the respect and gratitude of all men of good will throughout the world; and 
Whereas
 his life was an example for all of us and his death will require that our efforts and sacrifices in the cause of peace be redoubled: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, in honor and tribute to this great statesman of the world, do hereby direct that the appropriate officials arrange for the display of the National Flag at half-staff on all Government buildings of the United States until the body of Dag Hammarskjold is laid to rest. I also direct that, for the same length of time, the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the Flag at half-staff over all embassies, legations, consular offices, and military facilities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
