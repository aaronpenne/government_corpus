A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American mother has ever given her strength to the homes which are at the foundation of our national community; and
Whereas
 it has become our happy custom to unite on one day each year in giving public acknowledgment to our common bond of gratitude for the love and discipline of motherhood; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has recognized the fitness of this custom by designating the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 12, 1957, be observed as Mother's Day. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, and I urge upon the people of the Nation to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places, on that day.
Let all the sons and daughters of this country pay tribute to their mothers on the appointed day and renew their devotion to the high principles of humanity which mothers exemplify.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
Acting Secretary of State
