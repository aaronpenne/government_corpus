A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 in the opening of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, and Wichita Indian lands in the Territory of Oklahoma, by proclamation dated July 4, 1901 pursuant to section six of the act of Congress approved June 6, 1900 (31 Stat., 672, 676), the west half of the south-east quarter of the south-east quarter and lot fourteen, of section sixteen in township seven north, of range ten west of the Indian principal meridian, containing thirty-eight acres and sixty-hundredths of an acre, were reserved for the use of the Kiowa and Comanche Indian Agency;
And Whereas,
 it appears that said land is no longer used or required for use by said Indian agency, and that it adjoins the city of Anadarko, Oklahoma Territory, and is needed by said city for park purposes, the mayor of which city has applied to make entry thereof for said purposes under the act of Congress approved September 30, 1890 (26 Stat., 502).
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section six of said act of Congress of June 6, 1900, do hereby declare and make known that said land is hereby restored to the public domain, to be disposed of to said city for park purposes under said act of Congress approved September 30, 1890.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington, this twenty-third day of June, A. D. 1902, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-sixth.
