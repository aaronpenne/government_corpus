A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the continued well-being and economic progress of our rural families are vital to the strength of the Nation; and
Whereas
 accidents each year bring suffering and hardship to many rural inhabitants of our land and constitute a serious problem throughout the national community; and
Whereas
 programs of safety education and information have demonstrated their effectiveness in preventing accidents in the fields, in the homes, and on the highways and have greatly reduced the needless loss of life and property:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 19, 1959, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge farm families and persons allied with agriculture to join their efforts in a continuing campaign to prevent accidents. I also request all persons and organizations concerned for the welfare of farm people to support and participate in National Farm Safety Week.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
