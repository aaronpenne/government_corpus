By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 234 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984 (P.L. 98-573), I have determined that modifications in the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation, are appropriate in order to provide duty-free coverage comparable to the expanded coverage provided by other signatories to the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft (the Agreement; 31 UST (pt. 1) 619) as set forth in the Annex to the March 22, 1984, decision of the Committee on Civil Aircraft under the Agreement. 
2. I authorize the United States Trade Representative, or his designee, on behalf of the United States of America, to implement the portion of the consolidated Annex to the Agreement which pertains to articles imported into the United States, recorded in the decision of March 22, 1984, upon his determination that the additional duty-free treatment to be accorded by the United States, as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation, is comparable to the expanded coverage provided by other signatories to the Agreement. 
3. Pursuant to section 167(b) of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1982 (96 Stat. 2439, 19 U.S.C. 1202 note), I have determined that it is in the interest of the United States to implement, on a temporary basis, the duty-free treatment for such articles as are provided for in the amendment to section 163(c)(3) of that Act made by section 191(c)(2)(B) of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984. These articles were omitted through technical error from the 1982 Act implementing the Nairobi Protocol (97th Congress, 1st Session, Senate Treaty Document 97-2, p. 9) to the Florence Agreement on the Importation of Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials, and from Proclamation 5021 of February 14, 1983 (48 F.R. 6883), providing temporary duty reductions to certain imported articles. I have also determined, pursuant to section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2483), to modify the TSUS to provide temporary duty reductions to such additional articles. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to sections 234 of the Trade and Tariff Act of 1984, section 167(b)(2) of the Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Materials Importation Act of 1982, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, do proclaim that: 
(1) Item 960.70 in part 4 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified by inserting after "models)" the language ", globes,". This modification is effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after November 14, 1984. 
(2) The TSUS are further modified as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, attached hereto and made a part hereof. 
(3) The modifications to the TSUS made by paragraph (2) shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after the date designated by the United States Trade Representative or his designee and published in the Federal Register along with his determination that the duty-free coverage provided by the United States is comparable to the expanded coverage provided by other signatories to the Agreement. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
