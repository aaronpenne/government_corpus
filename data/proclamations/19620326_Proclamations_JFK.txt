A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the future strength, welfare, and progress of our Nation will be determined, in large measure, by the mental, emotional, spiritual, social, and physical fitness of its people; and 
Whereas
 the future fitness of our people will be strongly influenced, if not determined, by the fitness of our youth today; and 
Whereas
 the President's Council on Youth Fitness was established to develop and promote governmental and nongovernmental programs and activities conducive to the achievement of a happier, healthier, and more completely fit American youth; and 
Whereas
 maximum achievement in this regard can be accomplished only by a determined and coordinated effort by all of our people: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 6, 1962, as National Youth Fitness Week. 
I request officials of the Government, and I urge parents, young people, our schools, and interested national and local organizations, to use all appropriate means now and during that week to promote programs and activities demonstrating the importance of youth fitness to the end that we may assure the continuing strength and well-being of our people. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
