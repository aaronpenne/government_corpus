A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 throughout our national history free access to the printed word has been essential to educational and cultural advancement, to economic and technological development, and to the intelligent participation of the citizen in the affairs of our country; and
Whereas
 the libraries of our country play a major role in advancing these ends, and in enriching the life of our Nation, by bringing to the people informational, cultural, and recreational materials of all kinds; and
Whereas
 our cherished freedom to read has little meaning where books and other printed materials are not available; and
Whereas
 numerous national and local organizations are interested in focusing public attention on the services and resources of our libraries and their contribution to the civic welfare and cultural advancement of our Nation; and
Whereas
 the Congress by a concurrent resolution of March 14, 1958, has requested the President to issue a proclamation setting aside the period beginning on March 16 and ending on March 22, 1958, as National Library Week, and calling upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 16 and ending March 22, 1958, as National Library Week; and I urge the fullest possible participation in the observance of that week by the people of the United States. Let National Library Week be a time for the appraisal of community needs for library services and of the means for meeting them, for encouraging the development of a better-read, better-informed citizenry, and for rededication to that fine public service that has always been characteristic of the libraries of America.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 15th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
Acting Secretary of State
