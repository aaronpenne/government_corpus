A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski, Polish nobleman, was impelled by his enduring love of liberty to come to our shores and join in the fight for American independence; and
Whereas
 this valiant Pole, having attained the rank of Brigadier General in the Continental Army, gave his life for the American cause on October 11, 1779, thus becoming one of the immortals in our history; and
Whereas
 the American people, generation after generation, have remembered and cherished the gallant deeds of General Pulaski, who made a heroic contribution to the winning of the freedom we hold so dear:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Saturday, October 11, 1952, the one hundred and seventy-third anniversary of his death, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I invite the people of this Nation to observe the day with ceremonies designed to render homage to this Polish patriot who fought under freedom's banner. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on October 11 in honor of his memory.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
