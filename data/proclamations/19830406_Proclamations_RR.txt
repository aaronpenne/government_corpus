A Proclamation
 
Traditionally, this Nation honors its mothers by designating the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day. 
To our mothers we owe our highest esteem, for it is from their gift of life that the flow of events begins that shapes our destiny. A mother's love, nurturing, and beliefs are among the strongest influences molding the development and character of our youngsters. As Henry Ward Beecher wrote, "What a mother sings to the cradle goes all the way down to the coffin." 
Motherhood is both a great responsibility and one of the most rewarding and pleasurable experiences life has to offer. Mother's Day presents a special opportunity to appreciate our mothersâ€”to consider all they have done, and all they continue to do, in fostering children's physical and emotional growth, nursing illness, encouraging success, easing failure, maintaining family life, supporting their spouses, contributing vitally to the economy through their accomplishments at work, and serving their communities. The quality and scope of their activities, as well as their overriding concern for the well-being of their families and our country, inspires and strengthens us as individuals and as a Nation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 8, 1983, be observed as Mother's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
