A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it is provided by section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes", That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas,
 the public lands in the State of Oregon, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there are hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public Reservation all those certain tracts; pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Oregon and particularly described as follows, to wit:
In Township eight (8) South, Range thirty-seven (37) East, Willamette Meridian, Oregon, Sections one (1), two (2), three (3), ten (10) to fifteen (15), both inclusive, twenty-one (21) to twenty-seven (27), both inclusive, thirty-four (34), thirty-five (35) and thirty-six (36); in Township nine (9) South, Range thirty-seven (37) East, Sections one (1), two (2), three (3), ten (10) to fourteen (14), both inclusive, and twenty-three (23) to twenty-six (26), both inclusive; in Township eight (8) South, Range thirty-eight (38) East, the west half of the south-east quarter and the south-west quarter of Section five (5), Sections six (6), seven (7), eight (8), seventeen (17) to twenty (20), both inclusive, and twenty-nine (29) to thirty-four (34), both inclusive, and the west half of the north-west quarter and the west half of the south-west quarter of Section thirty-five (35); in Township nine (9) South, Range thirty-eight (38) East, Sections two (2) to thirty (30), both inclusive, and thirty-four (34), thirty-five (35) and thirty-six (36); in Township nine (9) South, Range thirty-nine (39) East, Sections seven (7), eighteen (18), nineteen (19), twenty (20), the west half of the north-west quarter and the west half of the south-west quarter of Section twenty-nine (29), Section thirty-one (31), and the west half of the north-west quarter of Section thirty-two (32).
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired:
 Provided
 , that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
The reservation hereby established shall be known as The Baker City Forest Reserve. In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and four and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-eighth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
