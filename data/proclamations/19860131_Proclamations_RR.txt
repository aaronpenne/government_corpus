By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Pursuant to sections 118(a)(1) and 552 (a)(1) of Public Law 99-190, I have determined that it is appropriate to deny nondiscriminatory (most-favored-nation) trade treatment to the products of Afghanistan and thereby to cause such products to be subject to the rate of duty set forth in column number 2 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 118(a)(1) and 552(a)(1) of Public Law 99-190, and section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, do proclaim that: 
1. General headnote 3(d) to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), listing those countries whose products are subject to the rate of duty set forth in column number 2 of the TSUS, is amended to include Afghanistan. 
2. This proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on and after the 14th day following the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
