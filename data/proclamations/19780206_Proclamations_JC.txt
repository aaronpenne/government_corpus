By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
When stored safely and used properly, products such as medicines, polishes, solvents and pesticides can make our lives easier. 
But many of these products contain toxic ingredients which, when used or stored carelessly, can find their way into the hands of our children. Although special packaging has reduced dramatically the number of incidents each year, household substances still poison many children. Therefore, the theme of this year's National Poison Prevention Week is: "Children Act Fast?So Do Poisons." 
To remind all Americans of the dangers of poisonings and to encourage all of us to eliminate this problem, the Congress, by joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681, 36 U.S.C. 165) has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 19, 1978, as National Poison Prevention Week. ! call upon the people of the United States and all agencies and organizations concerned with the prevention of poisoning and the welfare of our Nation's youngsters to join in promoting increased awareness of, and better protection against, the dangers of poisoning. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
