By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The number of deaths among children because of poisoning continues to decline. Many segments of our society have worked together to achieve this result and we can be proud of their efforts.
However, despite the progress we have made, the potential for poisoning is increasing. Medicines are being used more widely than before, and our advancing technology continues to make available for household use new products and materials which may be harmful if used improperly.
Because children will always have the urge to explore, we must redouble our efforts to emphasize proper use and storage of products which are potentially hazardous.
To focus attention on the dangers of accidental poisoning, the Congress in a joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 15, 1970, as National Poison Prevention Week.
I direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, and I invite State and local governments and organizations, to participate actively in programs designed to promote better protection against accidental poisonings, particularly as they relate to young children.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
