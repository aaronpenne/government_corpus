By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, had attained citizenship during the year, the Congress by a joint resolution of February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), set aside the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day; and by a joint resolution of August 2, 1956 (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1970. I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other interested organizations to make arrangements for impressive meaningful pageants and observances on that day to inspire all our citizens to rededicate themselves to the service of their country and to the support and defense of the Constitution.
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1970, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches, and in other suitable places, to the end that our citizens, whether naturalized or natural-born, may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the rights and responsibilities of United States citizenship.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
