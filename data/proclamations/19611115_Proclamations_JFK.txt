A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 an area in Arizona possessing outstanding scientific interest because of its exceptional growth of various species of cacti has been established as the Saguaro National Monument by Proclamation No. 2032 of March 1, 1933; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to add to the Saguaro National Monument certain lands lying within what is known as the Tucson Mountain Park which contain a remarkable display of relatively undisturbed lower Sonoran desert vegetation, including a saguaro stand which equals or surpasses saguaro stands elsewhere in the Nation; and 
Whereas
 the addition of these lands to the monument appears essential for their effective preservation and interpretation and for the implementation of the purposes of the Saguaro National Monument; and 
Whereas
 the Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings and Monuments, established pursuant to the act of August 21, 1935, 49 Stat. 666 (16 U.S.C. 463), impressed by the remarkable diversity of desert vegetation of this area and its significant wildlife qualities, has recommended its preservation by adding it to the Saguaro National Monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
