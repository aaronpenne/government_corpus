By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
To lead and to serve are the twin ideals of the United States Jaycees. By bringing together outstanding young members of communities throughout America, the Jaycees provide a reservoir and a forum for potential national leaders; by directing their energy and skills to a wide variety of humanitarian projects, the Jaycees serve our country and mankind. 
For more than half a century, the United States Jaycees have strengthened our life as a democratic society. They belong to a cherished tradition going back to our country's very beginnings when community leaders from throughout the 13 colonies-many of them young men like the Jaycees-banded together with vision and talent to forge a free nation. 
Today, in more than 7,000 chapters in each of the 50 states and the Nation's capital, some 300,000 Jaycees serve this time-honored ideal in a modern setting, dedicating their free time to faith, brotherhood, freedom and the service of their fellow man. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 19, 1975, as National Jaycee Week a time for the expression of America's gratitude for the many significant contributions of the United States Jaycees. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
