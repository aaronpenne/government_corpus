A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the restoration of commerce between nations, which was interrupted by the war, is of the greatest importance to the economic welfare of our country and of the world at large, as well as to the continuance of free government; and
Whereas
 the American Merchant Marine is contributing immeasurably to that objective by effecting the transportation of needed goods overseas, thus serving the ends of democracy in peace as it did in war; and
Whereas
 it is the considered policy of the United States, as expressed in the Merchant Marine Act of 1936, to develop and maintain a Merchant Marine adequate for the requirements of our trade and our national defense; and
Whereas
 the sailing of the Savannah on May 22, 1819, from Savannah, Georgia, on the first successful transoceanic voyage under steam propulsion constituted a significant milestone in the advancement of ocean transportation; and 
Whereas
 by joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), the congress designated May 22 as National Maritime Day and authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe that day;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 22, 1948, as national Maritime Day; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that day by displaying the flag of the United states at their homes or other suitable places, and I direct the officials of the Government to display the flag on that day on all Government buildings. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on National Maritime Day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 22nd day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
