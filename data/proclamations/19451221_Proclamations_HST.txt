A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 2500, dated August 9, 1941, the President declared and proclaimed the International Load Lines Convention, signed by the respective plenipotentiaries of the United States of America and certain other countries at London on July 5, 1930, suspended and inoperative in the ports and waters of the United States of America, and in so far as the United States of America was concerned, for the duration of the existing emergency; and
Whereas
 it appears that the continued suspension of the said International Load Lines Convention is no longer necessary or desirable:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do declare and proclaim that the said Proclamation No. 2500, dated August 9, 1941, is hereby revoked, effective as of January 1, 1946.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 21st day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
