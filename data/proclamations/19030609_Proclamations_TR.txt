By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 The Lewis and Clarke Forest Reserve and The Flathead Forest Reserve, in the State of Montana, were established by proclamations dated February twenty-second, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, under and by virtue of section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes", which provides, "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of .the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas,
 it is further provided by the Act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes", that "The President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve";
And Whereas,
 it appears proper that the areas embraced in said forest reserves, modified by various additions thereto and the elimination of certain lands, should be included in one reserve, and be designated by one name; and it appears that the public lands in the State of Montana, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that the proclamations heretofore issued respecting said forest reserves are hereby superseded and The Lewis and Clarke Forest Reserve is hereby established in place thereof, with boundaries as follows, to wit:

 Provided
 , That this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
 Provided further
 , That nothing herein shall give any force or effect to any claim or right to any of the lands heretofore embraced within the reserves hereby consolidated which would not have been entitled to recognition if said reserves as heretofore established had been continued in force without being merged into a single reserve as herein-before provided.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
The lands hereby eliminated from the reserve shall be open to settlement from the date hereof, but shall not be subject to entry, filing or selection until after ninety days' notice by such publication as the Secretary of the Interior may prescribe.
The rights and privileges reserved to the Indians of the Blackfeet Indian Reservation by Article 1 of the agreement set forth in, and accepted, ratified, and confirmed by, the Act of Congress approved June tenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, hereinbefore referred to respecting that portion of their reservation relinquished to the United States by said Article 1, shall be in no way infringed or modified by reason of the fact that a part of the area so relinquished is embraced within the limits of the boundaries herein described and set apart as a forest reservation; nor shall the right of occupation, location, and purchase of said relinquished lands under the provisions of the mineral-land laws, accorded by said Act of Congress, be abridged.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
