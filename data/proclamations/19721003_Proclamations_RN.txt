By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On Columbus Day, 1972, we once again celebrate the memorable achievements of the great navigator and explorer whose vision and daring led to much of the permanent settlement of the Americas by the peoples of Europe.
When Christopher Columbus, a son of Italy sailing in the service of Spain, crossed the uncharted ocean sea in 1492, he helped to open a new chapter in the history of mankind. Columbus was among the first in a long series of courageous trail blazers who have moved us forward across perilous areas of sea, land, and space in pursuit of greater knowledge of the globe and its surroundings.
All Americans take pride in recalling the accomplishments of Columbus. We count the memory of his courage in confronting unknown dangers and his indomitable faith in overcoming the setbacks which preceded his voyage as among the ideals which helped to shape the American character.
In tribute to the achievements of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified by the act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 9, 1972, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
