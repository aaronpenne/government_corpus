By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Uncontrolled fires continue to place a costly drain on the American economy. The tragedy of more than 12,000 deaths each year by fire is coupled with annual property losses exceeding $2 billion.
It is hard to realize that responsible citizens permit this to happen when most fires can be avoided. Each of us can reduce this waste simply by eliminating fire-producing conditions and by being alert and careful in handling fire.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 4, 1970, as Fire Prevention Week.
I call upon our citizens, singly and as a nation, to actively support fire prevention through civic groups, schools, business, labor, and farm organizations, State and local governments, and the fire prevention groups, including their own community fire departments, and the National Fire Protection Association. I urge the news media and other public information agencies to cooperate in promoting Fire Prevention Week as a prelude to year-round fire prevention efforts.
I also ask all Federal agencies, in cooperation with the Federal Fire Council, to assist the national effort to reduce loss of life and property from fire.
One way in which we can all assist this effort is by the reduction and elimination of false fire alarms. False alarms require the use of valuable fire fighting equipment which should be reserved for the bonafide protection of life and property. May this week be a reminder for all citizens to take appropriate action to arrest the needless and unwarranted interference with normal fire fighting operations and the ensuing cost to the taxpayer.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
