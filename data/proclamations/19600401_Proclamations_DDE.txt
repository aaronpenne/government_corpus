A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 ships that fly the flag of the United States serve our people in trade, commerce, and defense; and
Whereas
 American shipping is pioneering in the scientific development which this year will witness the harnessing of the atom for the benefit of mankind as the world's first nuclear-powered merchant ship, the N.S. Savannah, sails out upon the high seas; and
Whereas
 a strong United States Merchant Marine is essential to the economy and security of the free world; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), designated May 22 as National Maritime Day, in commemoration of the departure from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, of the S.S. Savannah on the first transoceanic voyage by any steamship, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of that day; and
Whereas
 May 22 falls on Sunday this year, it is appropriate that National Maritime Day be observed on the following Monday:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our Merchant Marine on Monday, May 23, 1960, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes or other suitable places; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day.
I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on Monday, May 23, in tribute to the American Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
