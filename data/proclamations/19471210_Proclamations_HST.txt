A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, cherished in our history as the Bill of Rights, became effective on December 15, 1791; and
Whereas
 the anniversary of the adoption of this hallowed declaration of our liberties affords a fitting occasion for rededication to its inspired and lofty principles; and
Whereas
 the Government of the United States has proposed the incorporation of these essential freedoms in a Declaration of Human Rights for all the peoples of the world:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate December 15, 1947, as Bill of Rights Day; and I call upon the officials of the Government and upon all citizens of the United States to observe that day by displaying the flag of the United States on public and private buildings and on homes, and by meeting together for appropriate ceremonies.
Since to comprehend and value our liberties is the first condition of remaining free, I urge the people of the Nation to reexamine and to reflect upon the provisions of our Constitution which secure our freedom under law - particularly the guarantees of freedom of religion, speech, the press, and assembly, as well as the pledges of fair trial and of security against unreasonable searches and seizures, and against the deprivation of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this tenth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
