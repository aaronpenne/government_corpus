By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
We know that America offers freedom and opportunity to every citizen; yet we know too that the burden of illiteracy keeps some of us from taking full advantage of all our country has to offer and from contributing all we can. Fortunately, dedicated citizens have been working hard to help their neighbors learn to read and write; and in recent years the Adult Literacy Initiative has encouraged many people to volunteer in this effort. 
We can be proud of the volunteers and the public-private partners who are carrying America's promise to their fellow citizens. National Literacy Day gives us a special chance to let more people know of the help and hope that are availableâ€”that they can truly learn to read and write. On this day and throughout the year, let us extend a helping hand to our fellow citizens and offer them the priceless opportunity of literacy and the world of potential it creates. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 304, has designated July 2, 1988, as "National Literacy Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 2, 1988, as National Literacy Day. I invite the Governors of the several States, local officials, and all Americans to observe this day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities to increase awareness about illiteracy and to encourage participation in the fight for literacy and learning in our land. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyeight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
