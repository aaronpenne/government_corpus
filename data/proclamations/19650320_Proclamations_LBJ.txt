A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, On March 17, 1965, the United States District Court for the middle district of Alabama entered an order in the case of Williams et al., Plaintiffs, United States of America, Plaintiff-Intervenor v. Wallace et al., Defendants, Civil Action No. 2181-N approving an exercise by the Plaintiffs and the members of the class they represent of their right to march along United States Highway 80 from Selma to Montgomery, Alabama, commencing in Selma, Alabama, not earlier than Friday, March 19, 1965, and not later than Monday, March 22,1965, and terminating in Montgomery, Alabama, within five days from commencement; and 
Whereas
, in relation to such judicial order and march the Governor of the State of Alabama has advised me that the state is unable and refuses to provide for the safety and welfare, among others, of the plaintiffs and the members of the class they represent; and 
Whereas
, as a consequence of such inability and refusal of the State of Alabama, and by reason of recent events in and about Selma and Montgomery, Alabama, there is a substantial likelihood that domestic violence may occur in connection with such march, with the consequence of obstructing the execution and enforcement of the laws of the United States, including the aforesaid judicial order: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States Code, particularly Sections 332, 333, and 334 thereof, do command all persons engaged or who may engage in such domestic violence obstructing the execution and enforcement of the laws to cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
Done at Johnson City, Texas, this twentieth day of March in the Year of our Lord Nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
