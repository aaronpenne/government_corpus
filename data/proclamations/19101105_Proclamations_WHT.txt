A Proclamation
 
This year of 1910 is drawing to a close. The records of population and harvests which are the index of progress show vigorous national growth and the health and prosperous well-being of our communities throughout this land and in our possessions beyond the seas. These blessings have not descended upon us in restricted measure, but overflow and abound. They are the blessings and bounty of God.
We continue to be at peace with the rest of the world. In all essential matters our relations with other peoples are harmonious, with an evergrowing reality of friendliness and depth of recognition of mutual dependence. It is especially to be noted that during the past year great progress has been achieved in the cause of arbitration and the peaceful settlement of international disputes.
Now, Therefore, I, William Howard Taft,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with the wise custom of the civil magistrate since the first settlements in this land and with the rule established from the foundation of this Government, do appoint Thursday, November 24, 1910, as a day of National Thanksgiving and Prayer, enjoining the people upon that day to meet in their churches for the praise of Almighty God and to return heartfelt thanks to Him for all His goodness and loving-kindness.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ten and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-fifth.
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT

ALVEYA ADEE,
