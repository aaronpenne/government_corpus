By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
, the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 are set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
, at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of subsection (d) of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to determine whether additional quantities of the articles provided for in items 950.07 through 950.10E of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter referred to as "cheese") may be entered for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas
, the said Commission has submitted to me a report of its investigation; and
Whereas
, on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that changed circumstances require the modification for a temporary period, as hereinafter proclaimed, of the quotas on cheese provided for in items 950.07 through 950.10E of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, in order to carry out the purposes of the said section 22; and
Whereas
, I find and declare that the allocation of shares of the import quotas proclaimed herein among the countries of origin shall be based upon the proportion of such articles supplied by such countries during the applicable representative periods, taking due account of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the articles concerned; and
Whereas
, I find and declare that the entry during the period ending July 31, 1973, of the additional quantities of cheese specified below will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that headnote 3(a) of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is temporarily amended by adding a new subdivision as follows:
(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, quantities of the articles described in items 950.07 through 950.10E, equivalent to 50 percentum of the total of the annual quota quantities for such articles may be entered during the period beginning April 25, 1973, and ending July 31, 1973, in addition to the total of the annual quota quantities specified for such articles. Such additional quantities may be entered only by or for the account of a person or firm to which a license has been issued under authority of the Secretary of Agriculture and in 'accordance with the terms of such license. Licenses shall be issued to the same persons or firms as licenses for the entry during calendar year 1973 of the quota quantities specified in items 950.07 through 950.10E. Licenses shall be issued on such basis that (a) each of the annual quota quantities provided for the articles described in items 950.07, 950.08B, 950.09A, 950.09B, 950.10, 950.10A, and for each of the supplying countries, wherever applicable are increased by 50 percentum for calendar year 1973, and (b) each of the annual quota quantities provided for the articles described in the items set forth in the following table and for each of the supplying countries, wherever applicable, are increased for calendar year 1973 by the amounts set forth in such table:
In addition to the foregoing and to the annual quota quantity specified for such article, up to 612,500 pounds of the article described in item 950.08A, consisting of natural cheddar cheese, the product of Canada, made from unpasteurized milk and aged not less than 9 months, which prior to the exportation has been certified to meet such requirements by an official of the Canadian Government, may be entered without license during the period beginning April 25, 1973, and ending July 31, 1973.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
