A Proclamation
 
The founding of the United Nations, on October 24, 1945, was an historic attempt to establish a framework for international cooperation. 
The nations of the world now face such tasks as maintaining international peace and security; promoting basic human rights; building a better international economic order; and allocating fairly the globe's natural resources. The United Nations and its affiliated agencies bring together representatives of all nations to work together toward these goals. It holds out the vision of a truly cooperative world?a world at peace. 
As one of its founding members, as its leading contributor, and as its host country, the United States feels a special pride in the Organization's accomplishments. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 24, 1978, as United Nations Day. 
I have appointed Clifton C. Garvin, Jr., to be United States National Chairman for United Nations Day. 
I urge Americans to become better acquainted with the institutions that make up the United Nations, to consider its role in addressing the problems of global interdependence, and to help it resolve the array of critical international issues that face us in these times. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
