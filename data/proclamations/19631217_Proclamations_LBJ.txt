A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on December 17, 1903, the Wright brothers, Orville and Wilbur, made the first successful flights in a heavier-than-air, mechanically propelled airplane, near Ditty Hawk, North Carolina; and 
Whereas
 the Wright brothers' genius and their vision have revolutionized transportation and defense methods and placed the United States in the forefront of world aviation; and 
Whereas
 by their deeds the Wright brothers have brought us closer together with the other peoples of the world; and 
Whereas
 it is most fitting that the great accomplishments of Orville and Wilbur Wright should be remembered and that they should be memorialized on the anniversary of their success; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 17, 1963, has designated the seventeenth day of December of each year as Wright Brothers Day, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon officials of the Government and the people of the United States to observe the day of December 17, 1963, with ceremonies and activities designed to commemorate the achievements of the Wright brothers and to further and stimulate interest in aviation in this country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
