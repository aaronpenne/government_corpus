A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States Army Air Forces began in 1907 as the Aeronautical Division in the Office of the Chief Signal Officer of the Army, with three men and no airplanes, and has grown to its present stature as one of the chief custodians of our future; and
Whereas
 the Army Air Forces contributed greatly to the victories against our enemies in Europe and in Asia, spearheading the attacks and carrying the battle into the heart of the enemy homelands; and
Whereas
 we look back with pride upon the noble achievements and the courageous deeds of the living and remember in affection the devoted service and the heroic sacrifices of the dead; and
Whereas
 we look forward to the increasing importance of American air power in preserving the peace; in defending America against aggression; and in strengthening the Union of our own country by swift, space-ignoring flight;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in order that we may in gratitude do honor to the men and women of the Army Air Forces and pay tribute to all those who through research and development, in science and industry, have supported the growth of our country's air power, do hereby proclaim Thursday, August 1, 1946, as Army Air Force Day, and do invite the Governors of the various States to issue proclamations calling for the observance of that day.
I strongly urge all citizens of this country to familiarize themselves with our Army Air Forces and to recall in appreciation the importance and the influence of air power in our national life in pioneering new means of transportation and communication and new contributions to our comfort, our health, and our well-being.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.
