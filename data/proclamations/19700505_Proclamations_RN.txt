By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In special recognition of the high esteem in which this nation holds mothers, we have customarily set aside a day to honor them.
The Congress by joint resolution approved May 8, 1914, declared that the second Sunday in May would be designated as Mother's Day, and requested the President to call for its observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 10, 1970, be observed as Mother's Day. I direct government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
