A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 four hundred and seventy-two years ago Christopher Columbus embarked on a daring voyage into an unknown sea and discovered a new world; and 
Whereas
, in the ensuing centuries, the continents of the world have been brought closer together in time and space by means of modern communications and transportation; and 
Whereas
 closer relationships between the peoples of the world have increased our awareness of the need for a just and lasting peace; and 
Whereas
 the vision, courage, and dedication of Columbus are a constant inspiration to us, both as individuals and as a Nation, as we seek a new world of peace and understanding; and 
Whereas
, in recognition of our debt to Columbus the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day for the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 12, 1964, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in churches, schools, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of Christopher Columbus. 
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings, on Columbus Day in honor of the great explorer. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth.
