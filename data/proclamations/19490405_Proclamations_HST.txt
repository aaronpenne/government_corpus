A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 international trade provides the medium by which the nations of the world exchange the products of their resources and skills; and 
Whereas
 the expansion of import and export trade improves standards of living, encourages full employment of labor and productive facilities, and speeds the development of human and natural resources throughout the world, thus laying the foundation for lasting world prosperity and peace; and
Whereas
 the United States advocates the removal of unnecessary restrictions and discriminations in international trade and accordingly has initiated a reciprocal-trade-agreements program and has taken steps in concert with other nations toward the establishment of an International Trade Organization:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week commencing May 22, 1949, as World Trade Week; and I urge the appropriate officials of the several States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, as well as the municipalities and other political subdivisions of the country, to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also invite business, educational, and other political subdivisions of the country, to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also invite business, educational, and civic groups, and the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with ceremonies, exhibits, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
