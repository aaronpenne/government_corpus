By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to section 22 are set forth in Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believed the import quota provided for in item 950.02 of Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) on the articles described in TSUS item 115.50 (hereinafter referred to as "nonfat dry milk") may be increased or suspended without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas,
 at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to determine whether the import quota provided for in TSUS item 950.02 on nonfat dry milk may be increased or suspended without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report with respect to this matter and I need to study further this matter before making a determination as to final action to be taken; and
Whereas,
 pending a determination as to final action'' to be taken, I find and declare, on the basis' of such investigation and report, that changed circumstances require modification of the import quota provided for in TSUS item 950.02 on nonfat dry milk during the period ending June 30, 1974, and that the entry of an additional quantity of 150,000,000 pounds of nonfat dry milk during such period will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that subdivision (vi) of headnote 3(a) of Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended to read as follows:
