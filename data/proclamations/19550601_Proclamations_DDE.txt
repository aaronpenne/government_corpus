A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the flag which we cherish as the emblem of our unity, our strength, and our free institutions, was adopted by resolution of the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777; and
Whereas
 under the protecting folds of this banner generations of Americans have enjoyed the blessings of liberty and justice inherent in our form of government; and
Whereas
 it has become our custom to observe June 14 with appropriate ceremonies commemorative of the adoption of the flag and expressive of our devotion to the Republic which it so nobly represents; and
Whereas
 in recognition of the fitness of such commemoration, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the appropriate officials of the Federal Government, and of the State and local Governments, to arrange for the display of our colors on all public buildings on Flag Day, June 14, 1955; and I urge all of our people to observe the day by flying the Stars and Stripes at their homes or other suitable places and by participating in ceremonies especially designed to honor the flag of the United States.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
