A Proclamation
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1869), I hereby proclaim, effective immediately, that: 
Any license for the importation of crude oil or gasoline as defined in Proclamation 4744 and issued thereunder shall remain valid, for purposes of Proclamation 3279, as amended, until 12:01 a.m. September 1, 1980, provided that the time period for which it was issued has not expired and that the volumes authorized to be imported under that license have not been entered into the United States. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
