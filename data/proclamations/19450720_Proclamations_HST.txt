A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States Army Air Forces have demonstrated throughout the world the ability of air power to spearhead the attacks of our Armed Forces against our enemies, and have materially contributed to the successful completion of the war in Europe; and
Whereas
 the men of the Army Air Forces have fought and died gallantly to win for us success in every corner of the world; and
Whereas
 millions of our countrymen, military and civilian, have recognized the potentialities of air power and have, in the Armed Services and on the home front, faithfully served and worked to achieve the air power essential to the winning of the wars in which we have been and are engaged:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in order that we may do honor to the men and women of the Army Air Forces and pay tribute to those who have supported the development of our Country's air power, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, August 1, 1945, as Air Force Day, and do invite the Governors of the various States to issue proclamations calling for the observance of that day.
I also strongly urge the civilian workers of this Country to maintain steadfastly their brilliant record of supplying our Army Air Forces with the weapons they must have to speed our final victory in this war.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 this 20th day of July in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and forty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JOSEPH C. GREW,
