By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Isolated from regular contact with society, many of our handicapped citizens lead lives of lonely frustration.
Working together, on both public and private levels, we can—and must—insure full lives for them. Together, we can topple the environmental barriers which prevent the handicapped from entering buildings or using public transportation; we can welcome back the returning disabled veterans to a life of hope; and we can bring all of our handicapped fellow citizens into the mainstream of American life.
The handicapped will not be the sole beneficiaries of this concerted effort. For the last quarter century our Nation has been enriched by using the substantial talents and energies of the disabled. For this reason, also, we must do more to reach those handicapped who have not been reached, and to offer new hope by providing increased opportunities for rehabilitation, training, and employment.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designating the first full week of October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 4, 1970, for such purpose.
During that week I urge all the Governors of States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry, educational and religious groups, labor, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, scientific, professional, and fraternal organizations, and all other interested organizations and individuals, including the handicapped themselves, to participate in this observance.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
