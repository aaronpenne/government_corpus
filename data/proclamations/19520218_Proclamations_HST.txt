A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross, designated by the Congress as a voluntary agency through which the people of this Nation may answer the call of their fellow Americans in distress, is facing unprecedented peacetime demands upon its resources; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross, as the national coordinating agency for the procurement of blood for defense, has greatly expanded its facilities for collecting the vast quantities of blood required for military and civilian use; and
Whereas
 this organization must continue to meet the need of servicemen, veterans, and their families for sympathetic aid and practical help with their problems, at home and overseas; and
Whereas
 in 1951 the Red Cross spent nearly $14,000,000 for the relief and rehabilitation of victims of one disaster alone - the Midwest floods of last summer-in addition to helping to meet the need of thousands of other disaster victims for shelter, food, and a return to normal living; and
Whereas
 the organization is expanding its health and safety services in order to train Americans everywhere to protect themselves and their families against the hazards of everyday life or a national emergency; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross is appealing for voluntary contributions amounting to a minimum of $85,000,000, so that it may heed the call of those in need of assistance throughout the Nation in the year ahead:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American national Red Cross, do hereby designate the month of March 1952 as Red Cross Month; and I urge every American to contribute during that month as generously as possible to this humanitarian cause.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
