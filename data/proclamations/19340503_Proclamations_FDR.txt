By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by House Joint Resolution 263, approved and signed by President Wilson on May 8, 1914, the second Sunday in May of each year has been designated as Mother's Day for the expression of our love and reverence for the mothers of our country; and
Whereas
 Senate Resolution 218, adopted April 26, 1934, states that "there are throughout our land today an unprecedentedly large number of mothers and dependent children who, because of unemployment or loss of their bread-earners, are lacking many of the necessities of life," and the President of the United States is therein authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of Mother's Day this year;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon our citizens to express on Mother's Day, Sunday, May 13, 1934, our love and reverence for motherhood:
(a) By the customary display of the United States flag on all Government buildings, homes, and other suitable places;
(b) By the usual tokens and messages of affection to our mothers; and
(c) By doing all that we can through our churches, fraternal and welfare agencies for the relief and welfare of mothers and children who may be in need of the necessities of life.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
