A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Governor of the State of Alabama, together with certain other officials of that State, and other persons, individually and in unlawful assemblies, combinations, and conspiracies, have been and are willfully opposing and obstructing the execution of the laws of the United States, including the enforcement of orders entered by the United States District Courts in the State of Alabama relating to the enrollment and attendance of students in public schools in that State, and have been and are impeding the course of justice under those laws; and 
Whereas
 such unlawful assemblies, combinations, and conspiracies make it impracticable to enforce the laws of the United States in the State of Alabama by the ordinary course of judicial proceedings; and 
Whereas
 such unlawful assemblies, combinations, and conspiracies so hinder the execution of the laws of the State of Alabama, and of the United States within the State of Alabama, that a part or class of its people is deprived of rights, privileges, immunities, and protections named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State refuse to protect such rights, privileges, or immunities, or to give that protection: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States, under and by virtue of, the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including; Chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States Code, particularly Sections 332, 333 and 334 thereof, do command all persons engaged in such unlawful obstructions of justice, assemblies, combinations, and conspiracies to cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
