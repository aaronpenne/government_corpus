By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), by Presidential Proclamation limitations have been imposed on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
, in accordance with section 102(3) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963 (28 F.R. 9279), proclaimed the additional import restrictions set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions on certain dairy products set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 3548 have been amended by Proclamation No. 3558 of October 5, 1963; Proclamation No. 3562. of November 26, 1963; Proclamation No. 3597 of July 7, 1964; section 88 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 950); Proclamation No. 3709 of March 31, 1966; Proclamation No. 3790 of June 30, 1967; Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967; Proclamation No. 3856 of June 10, 1968; Proclamation No. 3870 of September 24, 1968; Proclamation No. 3884 of January 6, 1969; Proclamation No. 4026 of December 31, 1970; and Proclamation No. 4138 of June 3, 1972; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believes that additional quantities of dried milk provided for in item 950.02 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter referred to as "nonfat dry milk") may be imported for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas
, under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has determined and reported to me that a condition exists with respect to nonfat dry milk which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on nonfat dry milk should be increased during the period ending February 15, 1973, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the importation during the period ending February 15, 1973, of the additional quantity of nonfat dry milk specified below will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and that a condition exists which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on nonfat dry milk should be increased during such period without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that headnote 3 (a) of Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is temporarily amended by adding a new subdivision as follows:
(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, 25,000,000 pounds of dried milk described in item 115.50 may be entered during the period beginning December 30, 1972 and ending February 15, 1973, in addition to the annual quota quantity specified for such article under item 950.02, and import licenses shall not be required for entering such additional quantity. No individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity (including its affiliates or subsidiaries) may during such period enter pursuant to this provision quantities of such additional dried milk totaling in excess of 2,500,000 pounds.
The additional quota quantity provided for herein shall continue in effect pending Presidential action upon receipt of the report and recommendations of the Tariff Commission with respect thereto.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
