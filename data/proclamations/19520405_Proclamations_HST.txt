A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 the promotion of conditions that make for sound health for the nation's children should be of vital concern to all Americans; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we set aside a day each year for special consideration of means for the improvement of the health and well-being of our children:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the first day of May, 1952, as Child Health Day; and I invite all agencies and organizations interested in the well-being of children to unite upon that day in celebrating the past year's gains in the health of children and in considering how programs for the protection and development of the health of the rising generation may be further advanced.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this Fifth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
