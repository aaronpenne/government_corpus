By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Each year, more than one million children are the victims of child abuse and child neglect. These children represent every racial, religious, and socio-economic group, and the suffering they endure poses a threat to our families and to our society as a whole. 
Most instances of child abuse and child neglect are not caused by inhuman, hateful intent but by the accumulation of stresses experienced by parents attempting to meet their responsibilities. If parents can get help in coping with the pressures in their lives and if communities support preventive programs to assist parents and others responsible for the care of their children, young lives can be saved and suffering prevented. 
The health and well-being of our children is arid must continue to be one of our Nation's highest priorities. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 149, has recognized the magnitude of the problem of child abuse by requesting me to designate June 6 through June 12, 1982, as National Child Abuse Prevention Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of June 6 through June 12, 1982, as "National Child Abuse Prevention Week." I urge all citizens to renew our Nation's commitment to meet the serious challenge which child abuse and child neglect pose to the welfare of our children and families. 
I especially invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; the heads of voluntary and private groups; and the offices of local, State, and Federal government to join in this observance. I urge them to encourage activities whose purpose is to prevent and treat child abuse and child neglect. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
