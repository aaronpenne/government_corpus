By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Schoolbus transportation serves a very special and important segment of this Nationâ€”our children. More than twenty-two million young Americans use schoolbuses to get to school. 
When we consider the millions of young people who are transported and the millions of trips schoolbuses make each year, we can take great pride in our safety record. Nevertheless, we must reaffirm our commitment to providing the safest possible transportation for our children. They are our most important resource, and their safe transport deserves to be one of our highest priorities. 
In recognition of the national program which is underway to call public attention to the importance of school bus safety, and in recognition of the importance of safe transport of our young students to and from school, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 137, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week of October 2 through October 8, 1983, as National Schoolbus Safety Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning on October 2, 1983, as National Schoolbus Safety Week. I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe that week with appropriate activities and ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
