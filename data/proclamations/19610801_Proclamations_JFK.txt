A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 equality of opportunity has long been one of our most cherished ideals; and 
Whereas
 equality of opportunity for employment should not be denied any qualified person because of a physical handicap; and 
Whereas
 the physically handicapped of our country have amply demonstrated their productive capacity when employed in positions suited to their special skills and talents; and 
Whereas
 there are in this Nation today those who are physically Handicapped but are otherwise qualified for useful work who have not yet achieved equality of opportunity for employment; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), has designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week and has requested the President to issue a suitable proclamation each year: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 1, 1961, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped in furthering equality of opportunity for employment of the physically handicapped. 
I also urge the Governors of States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry, educational and religious groups, labor, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, scientific, professional, and fraternal organizations, and all other interested organizations and individuals, including the handicapped themselves, to participate actively in this observance. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK, 
Secretary of State.
