Whereas
 four Army chaplains—a Methodist minister, a minister of the Reformed Church, a Roman Catholic priest, and a Jewish rabbi—led those on board the vessel in prayer, and gave their own lifejackets to others, creating a saga of faith and heroism that will long remain an inspiration to all who believe in God and love their country; and

Goode, of York, Pennsylvania, Jewish; Clark V. Poling, of Schenectady, New York, Reformed Church in America; and John P. Washington, of Newark, New Jersey, Roman Catholic; and

In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
