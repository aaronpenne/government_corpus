A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the supreme and selfless sacrifice of those who gave their lives on the field of honor have made it possible for succeeding American generations to remain free and enjoy the spiritual and material blessings of our free society; and 
Whereas
 the courage and ideals of our noble dead have contributed to the advancement of the cause of world freedom and stand as an inspiration to us all; and 
Whereas
 in our time we face a challenge which demands of us the same virtues of loyalty, courage, and devotion to country that characterized our fallen heroes; and 
Whereas
 Memorial Day each year provides a fitting occasion upon which Americans may not only pay tribute to our honored dead but also unite in prayer for success in our search for a just and lasting peace; and 
Whereas
 to this end the Congress, in a joint resolution approved May 11, 1950 (64 Stat. 158), requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people of the United States to observe each Memorial Day as a day of prayer for permanent peace: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Memorial Day, Wednesday, May 30, 1962, by invoking the blessing of God on those who have died in defense of our country, and by praying for a new world of law where peace and justice shall be assured for all; and I designate the hour beginning in each locality at eleven o'clock in the morning of that day as the time to unite in such prayer. 
I also urge the press, radio, television, and all other media of information to cooperate in this observance. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this Eighteenth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
