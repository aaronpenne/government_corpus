By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The National School Lunch Program celebrates its Silver Anniversary this year. For the past quarter century, this important program has made a magnificent contribution to both the education and the health of our Nation.
The National School Lunch Program is a product of cooperation among parents, civic groups, and all levels of government. It encourages better nutrition for the schoolchildren of America. In all the participating schools, this program provides free or reduced-price lunches to needy pupils.
The Congress, by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962, designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe the week of October 10, 1971, as National School Lunch Week with appropriate ceremonies and activities designed to promote good nutrition in our schools.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 9th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
