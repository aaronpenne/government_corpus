By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
WHEREAS; I have been informed that conditions of domestic violence and disorder exist in and about the Virgin Islands endangering life and property and obstructing execution of the laws, and that the law enforcement resources available to that territory, including the National Guard, are unable to suppress such acts of violence and to restore law and order; and 
WHEREAS; such domestic violence and disorder are also obstructing the execution of the laws of the United States, and endangering the security of Federal property and function, in and about the Virgin Islands. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States Code, do command all persons engaged in such acts of violence to cease and desist therefrom and to disperse and retire peaceably forthwith. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
