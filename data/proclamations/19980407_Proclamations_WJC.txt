By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As a new century of great promise and possibility approaches, as science and technology advance at astonishing rates, it is clear that now, more than ever, education is the key to our children's future.
We should also recognize that education must serve not only as a path to knowledge, but also as a means to develop the character of out Nation's youth. When expanding educational opportunities, we must ensure that in addition to raising academic standards, we emphasize values, personal responsibility, and community spirit.
A firm believer in nurturing both mind and heart, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem M. Schneerson, devoted his life to helping young people realize their potential and become visionary leaders and thinkers, as well as concerned, caring, and productive citizens. He established more than 2,000 educational and social institutions in more than 40 States and nearly 60 countries. He was deeply committed to fostering civic pride and moral integrity along with professional success.
On this day, as we remember Rabbi Schneerson's achievements, let us reaffirm our commitment to providing our Nation's children with an education that will enable them to flourish, both intellectually and spiritually.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim April 7, 1998, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I invite Government officials, educators, volunteers, and all of the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate activities, programs, and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-second.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
