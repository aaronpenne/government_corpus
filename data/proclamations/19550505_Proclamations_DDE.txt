A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 since the earliest days of our history American mothers have inspired our most exalted national ideals through their teachings and by example in their daily lives; and
Whereas
 it has become our felicitous custom to set aside one day each year for commemorating motherhood and for showing our reverence and love for all the mothers of the land; and
Whereas
 in recognition of the fitness of such commemoration, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), has designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 8, 1955, be celebrated as Mother's Day; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day.
I also call upon the people of the Nation to give public and private expression to the esteem in which our country holds its mothers, through the display of the flag at their homes and other suitable places, through prayers at their places of worship, and through appropriate manifestations of respect and devotion.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
