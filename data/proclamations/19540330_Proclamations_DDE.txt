A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 more accidental deaths occur in farming than in any other major industry in this country; and
Whereas
 a disabling injury strikes some farm person in America every twenty-six seconds, on an average, as the result of an avoidable accident; and
Whereas
 this appalling loss can be greatly reduced by the exercise of care and caution on the part of farm people:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week beginning July 25, 1954, as National Farm Safety Week; and I urgently request all farm residents to make every effort to develop safe work habits and skills, so that they may "Farm To Live and Live To Farm". I also request all persons and organizations interested in farm life and welfare to join in a campaign to free as many farm homes as possible from the tragedies and losses caused by needless accidents.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
