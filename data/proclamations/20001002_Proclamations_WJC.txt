By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Section 111(a) of the African Growth and Opportunity Act (Title I of Public Law 106-200) (AGOA) amends Title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the "1974 Act"), to provide, in new section 506A(a) (19 U.S.C. 2466a(a)), that the President is authorized to designate countries listed in section 107 of the AGOA as "beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries."
2. Section 112(a) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(a)) provides that eligible textile and apparel articles that are imported directly into the customs territory of the United States from a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country shall enter the United States free of duty and free of quantitative limitations, provided that the country has satisfied the requirements of section 113(a) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3722(a)) relating to the establishment of procedures to protect against unlawful transshipments, and section 113(b)(1)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3722(b)(1)(B)) relating to the implementation of procedures and requirements similar to those in chapter 5 of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA).
3. Section 112(b)(3)(B) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(b)(3)(B)) provides special rules for certain apparel articles imported from "lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African countries."
4. Section 112(c) of the AGOA (19 U.S.C. 3721(c)) provides that the President shall eliminate the existing quotas on textile and apparel articles imported into the United States (a) from Kenya within 30 days after that country adopts an effective visa system to prevent unlawful transshipment of textile and apparel articles and the use of counterfeit documents relating to the importation of the articles into the United States, and (b) from Mauritius within 30 days after that country adopts such a visa system.
5. In order to implement the tariff treatment provided under the AGOA, it is necessary to modify the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS), thereby incorporating the substance of the relevant provisions of the AGOA.
6. Sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462) authorize the President to designate countries as beneficiary developing countries for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP).
7. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
8. I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to perform the functions specified in sections 112(c) and 113(b)(1)(B) of the AGOA and to make the findings identified in section 113(a) of the AGOA and to perform certain functions under section 604 of the 1974 Act.
9. For Sierra Leone, I have determined that it is appropriate to authorize the USTR to determine the effective date of its designation as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

To implement such determination or determinations, the USTR is authorized to exercise the authority provided to the President under section 604 of the 1974 Act to embody modifications and technical or conforming changes in the HTS.
(6) The USTR is authorized to determine the effective date of the designation of the Republic of Sierra Leone as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country and, therefore, the date upon which Sierra Leone will be considered a lesser developed beneficiary sub-Saharan African country.

(9) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders that are inconsistent with the actions taken in this proclamation are superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(10) This proclamation is effective on the date of signature of this proclamation, except that (a) the modifications to the HTS made by the Annex to this proclamation, as further modified by any notice to be published in the Federal Register as described in paragraph 4 of this proclamation, shall be effective on the date announced by the USTR in such notice, and (b) the designation of the Republic of Sierra Leone as a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country shall be effective on the date announced by the USTR in the Federal Register.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October, in the year of our Lord two thousand, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-fifth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
