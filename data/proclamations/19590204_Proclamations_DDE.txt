Whereas
 the dental health of our children is a basic part of their general well-being; and
Whereas
 dental diseases are among the most widespread of the ailments of childhood, and dental neglect can cause suffering and disability in later years; and
Whereas
 our dental profession is observing in 1959 the one-hundredth anniversary of its organization and is reemphasizing the importance of preventing dental disease; and
Whereas
 a joint resolution of the Congress, approved on August 28, 1958 (72 Stat. 986), authorized the President to issue a proclamation setting aside the period from February 8 to 14, 1959, as National Children's Dental Health Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning February 8 and ending February 14, 1959, as National Children's Dental Health Week; and I request the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to participate fully in the observance of that week. I also invite State and local governments and organizations interested in child welfare to unite during that week in such activities as will call to the attention of the people of the United States the necessity of a continuous program for the protection of the dental health of the Nation's children.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
