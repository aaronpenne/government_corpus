By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas,
 pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821), the President, by Proclamation No. 2929 of June 2, 1951, No. 3140 of June 13, 1956, and No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (65 Stat. c12, 70 Stat. c33, and 82 Stat. 1455), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties as were found to be required or appropriate to carry out trade agreements into which he had entered;
2. 
Whereas
 among the proclaimed modifications were modifications in the rate of duty on pianos which are now provided for in item 725.02 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS);
3. 
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its Investigation No. TEA–I14 under section 301 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1901), on the basis of which investigation and a hearing duly held in connection therewith the said Commission has determined that pianos provided for in TSUS item 725.02 are, as a result in major part of concessions granted under trade agreements, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to threaten to cause serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products; and
4. 
Whereas
 I have determined that an increase in the prevailing rate of duty on pianos, except grand pianos, provided for in TSUS item 725.02, to a rate of duty of 13.5 percent ad valorem as hereinafter proclaimed is necessary to prevent serious injury to the piano industry:
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including sections 201(a) (2), 302(a) (2) and (3), and 351 (a) (1) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2), 19 U.S.C. 1902(a) (2) and (3), and 1981 (a) (1)), and in accordance with section 253(d) of said Act (19 U.S.C. 1883(d)), and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat.
