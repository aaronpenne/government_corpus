By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to subsections 502(b)(7), 502(e)(7), and sections 504 and 604 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462, 2464 and 2483), I have determined that it is appropriate to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Chile. Such suspension is the result of my determination that Chile has not taken and is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the Trade Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(4)). 
2. Subsections 502 (b)(7) and (c)(7) of the Trade Act provide that a country that has not taken or is not taking steps to afford such internationally recognized worker rights is ineligible for designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. Section 504 authorizes the President to withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any article or with respect to any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)). 
3. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 502, 504, and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) General headnote 3(e)(v)(A) to the TSUS is modified by striking out "Chile" from the enumeration of independent countries whose products are eligible for benefits under the GSP. 
(2) No article the product of Chile and imported into the United States after the effective date of this Proclamation shall be eligible for preferential treatment under the GSP. 
(3) This Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the sixtieth (60th) day following the date of the publication of this Proclamation in the Federal Register. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 24th day of Dec., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
