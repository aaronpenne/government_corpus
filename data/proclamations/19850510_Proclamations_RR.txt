By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Correctional officers occupy a vital role in our Nation's criminal justice systems. They are called upon to ensure the custody, safety, and well-being of the over 680,000 inmates in prisons and jails. Without these officers performing demanding and often dangerous assignments, it would be impossible to carry out the primary law enforcement mission of protecting the law-abiding citizens of this country. 
In a time of rapidly growing inmate populations, the demands upon correctional officers are many. As the backbone of our correctional systems, they work hard to maintain the high professional standards necessary to ensure the safe and orderly running of our Nation's prisons and jails. The dedication exhibited by these officers in the daily performance of their duties deserves our greatest respect and appreciation. 
In recognition of the contributions of correctional officers to our Nation, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 64, has designated the week beginning May 5, 1985, as "National Correctional Officers Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue an appropriate proclamation in commemoration of the observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 5, 1985, as National Correctional Officers Week. I call upon officials of State and local governments and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
