By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, adopted the design of our Nation's flag, which we cherish as the emblem of our freedom, our strength, and our unity; and
Whereas
 the flag also symbolizes our glorious past and our determination to preserve in the future those ideals and principles which are the foundations of our Nation's greatness; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag be displayed on all Government buildings on Sunday, June 14, 1953, and I call upon all our people to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies. Let us display the flag proudly at our homes and other suitable places, giving solemn thought to the inestimable privileges of living under its protective stars and stripes, and let us rededicate ourselves to the corresponding obligations—of patriotism, service, and mutual respect—which are inherent in those privileges.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
