By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In slightly more than a decade, the sport of tennis has been transformed from an entertainment for relatively few to an enthusiasm of millions. 
What began in England at the estate of Major Walter Clopton Wingfield in 1873 as the modern game of tennis, has now blossomed in America as the physical fitness sport of over 20 million Americans. 
Last year, Tennis Week was recognized by twenty-seven governors and fifty-four mayors throughout our Nation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the fourth week in June, 1976, as National Tennis Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
