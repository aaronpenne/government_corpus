A Proclamation
 
In May, 1974, a six-month International Exposition on the Environment will open in Spokane, Washington, inviting the nations of the world to think anew of man's relationship to Earth.
This Exposition, whose theme is "Progress Without Pollution", will not only mark the centennial of Spokane but will also provide a splendid setting in which to explore new ways to restore and preserve our natural surroundings.
Because of the opportunities which the Exposition offers for a deeper understanding of environmental issues and for stimulating trade and cultural exchange, this administration is moving to extend the fullest possible recognition to this event in accordance with Public Law 91-269. On October 15, 1971, I advised the Secretaries of State and Commerce that the Exposition warrants Federal recognition as provided by statute. On November 24, 1971, upon request of the United States, the Bureau of International Expositions in Paris officially recognized the event as a Special Category exposition by unanimous vote.
Also, in accordance with law, I shall appoint a United States Commissioner General to exercise the responsibility of the United States Government for fulfillment of the Convention Relating to International Expositions of November 22, 1928, as modified, and to invite the several States of the Union to participate.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, in further recognition of this international exposition, do hereby authorize and direct the Secretary of State to invite, on my behalf, such foreign countries as he may consider appropriate to participate in this event.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 31st day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
