By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
During the past three decades, this nation has made great progress in helping handicapped Americans find work. Seven million men and women have overcome disabilities and found a place for themselves in industry, commerce, and the professions.
As favorable as are the statistics documenting this achievement, there are still many handicapped persons in need of rehabilitation. Programs are needed which will continue and expand the work which has already been done.
Yet even the best programs are not enough if they are not matched by a growth of understanding on the part of employers and the public at large. Misconceptions concerning disability must be supplanted by facts.
We must help the physically handicapped not only because it enables them to build better lives, but also because an American who is employed despite his handicap can help to build a better nation for all of us.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of Congress approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designating the first full week of October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 5, 1969, for such purpose.
During that week I urge all the Governors of States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry, educational and religious groups, labor, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, scientific, professional, and fraternal organizations, and all other interested organizations and individuals, including the handicapped themselves, to participate in this observance.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
