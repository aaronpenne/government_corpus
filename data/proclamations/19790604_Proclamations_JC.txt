By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In each of America's past wars our prisoners of war have represented a special sacrifice. On them has fallen an added burden of loneliness, trauma, and hardship. Their burden becomes double when there is inhumane treatment by the enemy in violation of common human compassion, ethical standards, and international obligations. 
The Congress has by Joint Resolution (Public Law 95-349) designated July 18, 1979, as "National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day." 
As we now enjoy the blessings of peace, it is appropriate that all Americans recognize the special debt owed those Americans held prisoner during wartime. It also is appropriate that we remember the unresolved casualties of war, our soldiers who are missing. The pain and bitterness of war endures for the families, relatives and friends of those whose fate is unknown. Our Nation will continue to seek answers to the questions that remain about their fate. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, July 18, 1979, as National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day, a day dedicated both to all former American prisoners of war as well as those still missing and to their families. I call on all Americans to join on this occasion in honoring those who made the special sacrifice of being captive in war, and their loved ones. 
And I call on State and local officials and private organizations to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
