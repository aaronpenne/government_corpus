By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
November 4, 1979, is the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of America's leading philosopher-humorist, Will Rogers. 
His commentary on people and events in public life amused us all?and made us a little wiser, too. He judged people with penetrating insight, but with kindness and affection. 
He once said, "I never tell jokes. I just watch the government and report the facts." The wit and the wisdom exemplified by that comment made this Nation a better place in which to live. 
In recognition of his contribution to the enrichment of our lives, the Ninety-Sixth Congress, by House Joint Resolution 3, has requested the President to designate November 4, 1979, as Will Rogers Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, November 4, 1979, as Will Rogers Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth. 
JIMMY CARTER
