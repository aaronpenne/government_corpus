A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the date of April 14 marks the anniversary of the founding of the Pan American Union in 1890 and has come to be observed annually as a commemorative symbol of the bonds of friendship and common interest among the nations of the Western Hemisphere; and
Whereas
 the exigencies of war have brought to the nations of the world new realization of their interdependence and new determination to join together to achieve a just and lasting peace and to promote and maintain the welfare, security and prosperity of all peoples everywhere; and
Whereas
 it is accordingly appropriate that this anniversary of Pan American unity be again observed in order that the people of the United States may publicly testify to the mutual confidence and good will existing between them and the peoples of the other American republics and to the mutual advantages to be gained through development of closer international cultural, trade and political relations;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby order that the week beginning April 14, 1946, be designated and known as "Pan-American Week" and that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings during that week. I also invite the Governors of the several States, Territories and possessions of the United States and the appropriate officials of the various municipalities and other political subdivisions to take similar action with respect to either the entire week or any designated day or days thereof. I further call upon the churches, educational institutions, civic associations, clubs, business establishments and other organizations, and the people of the United States generally, to observe this Pan-American Week with fitting commemorative ceremonies, displays, exhibits or other activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth.
