A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our transportation system is a vital network which spans a continent, helps keep the wheels of commerce and industry turning, and makes us the most mobile society in the history of the world; and 
Whereas
 not only our commercial and economic and personal lives, but also the very defense of the Nation, are dependent upon modern and efficient transportation; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 22 of May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President to proclaim annually the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day, and by House Joint Resolution 628 of May 14, 1962 (76 Stat. 69), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week of May in which that Friday falls as National Transportation Week, as a tribute to the men and women who, working night and day, move the goods and people throughout our land: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, May 21, 1965, as National Defense Transportation Day, and the week beginning May 16, 1965, as National Transportation Week; and I urge our people to participate, with representatives of the transportation industry, our armed services and other governmental agencies, in the observance of these occasions through appropriate ceremonies. 
I also invite the Governors of the States to provide for the observance of National Defense Transportation Day and National Transportation Week in a way that will give the citizens of each community the opportunity to recognize and appreciate fully the vital role our peat and modern transportation system plays-in their daily lives and in the defense of our Nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
