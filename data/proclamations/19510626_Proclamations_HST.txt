A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Muir Woods National Monument, California, was established by Proclamation No. 793 of January 9, 1908 (35 Stat. 2174), and was enlarged by proclamations No. 1608 of September 22, 1921 (42 Stat. 2249), and No. 2122 of April 5, 1935 (49 Stat. 3443), to protect a most extraordinary growth of redwood trees (Sequoia Sempervirens) of primeval character; and
Whereas
 the said monument is comprised of various parcels of land conveyed to the United States, as donations, from time to time for national-monument purposes, as separately described and set out in the above-mentioned proclamations; and
Whereas
 the William Kent Estate Company, a corporation of the State of California, has conveyed to the United States, as a donation, a tract of land adjoining the southwesterly boundary of the monument to afford better protection to the monument and to promote its administration and development; and
Whereas
 the United States has acquired from the State of California a leasehold interest in a tract of land adjoining the southeasterly boundary of the monument to afford better protection to the monument and to promote its administration and development; and 
Whereas
 there lies at the entrance to the monument a tract of land belonging to the William Kent Estate Company which is needed for additional visitor parking space and for other purposes incident to the proper development and administration of the monument and which is in process of acquisition by the United States for such purposes; and
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest (1) to enlarge the Muir Woods National Monument by adding thereto the said tract of land donated to the United States by the William Kent Estate Company and the said tract of land leased to the United States by the State of California, (2) to extend the boundaries of the monument so as to include therein such additional lands and the said tract of land owned by the William Kent Estate Company, and (3) to provide that the last-mentioned tract of land shall become a part of the monument upon acquisition of title thereto or control thereof by the United States:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing rights, the lands within the following-described boundaries which are now owned or controlled by the United States shall constitute the Muir Woods National Monument, and that the above-described tract of land within such boundaries which is now owned by the William Kent Estate Company shall become a part of such monument upon the acquisition of title thereto or control thereof by the United States:
