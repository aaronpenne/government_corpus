By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Stories of brave men battling fearful odds fire our imaginations. We honor such men long after the memories of their adventures have been dimmed by time. 
So it is with Leif Erikson. His original discovery and exploration of North America was the supreme achievement of a race of men who truly were the masters of the sea. His voyage enlarged mankind's horizons and pointed the way West for the others who were to follow. 
Today we honor Leif Erikson, and in honoring him we also honor the human qualities of imagination, courage, and perseverance which characterize both his men of old and Americans of Scandinavian descent today. 
As a mark of respect for the achievements of Leif Erikson and his followers, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849, 36 U.S.C. 169c), authorized the President to proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 9, 1978, as Leif Erikson Day and I direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
