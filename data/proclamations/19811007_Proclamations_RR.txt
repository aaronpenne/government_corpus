By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
America has lost a close friend; the world has lost a great statesman and mankind has lost a champion of peace. 
President Sadat was a courageous man whose vision and wisdom brought nations and people together. 
In a world filled with hatred, he was a man of hope. In a world trapped in the animosities of the past, he was a man of foresight, a man who sought to improve a world tormented by malice and pettiness. 
He was admired and loved by the people of America. His death yesterday—an act of infamy, cowardly infamy—fills us with horror. 
As a mark of respect for the memory of Anwar Sadat I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
