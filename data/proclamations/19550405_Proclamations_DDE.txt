A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States of America was one of the nations instrumental in establishing the United Nations in an effort to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war; and
Whereas
 it is the consistent policy of the Government of the United States to encourage and support the work of the United Nations in that effort; and
Whereas
 the United Nations has entered on its tenth year of unremitting labor toward realizing the hopes of man-kind for an ordered world based on the supremacy of reason and justice; and
Whereas

I also call upon the officials of the Federal, State, and local Governments, the United States Committee for the United Nations, representatives of civic, educational, and religious organizations, and agencies of the press, radio, television, and motion pictures, as well as all citizens, to cooperate in appropriate observance throughout our country of this tenth anniversary of the United Nations.
In Witness Whereof
