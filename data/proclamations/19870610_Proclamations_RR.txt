A Proclamation
 
On June 12, 1987, the Ohio State University will observe its 300th Commencement Exercise since it opened in September 1873 as the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College, a land-grant college for the Buckeye State under the Morrill Act of 1862. Today Ohio State has more than 50,000 students and its large body of alumni makes outstanding contributions in every area of endeavor in Ohio and throughout our country and the world. 
The tradition of excellence in higher education at the Ohio State University enriches our Nation. We can all share in and celebrate Ohio State's theme for its 300th Commencement, "A Distinguished Past, a Dynamic Future." 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 280, has designated June 12, 1987, as a day of observation of the occasion of the 300th Commencement Exercise at the Ohio State University and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 12, 1987, as a day of observation of the occasion of the 300th Commencement Exercise at the Ohio State University. I call upon all Americans to observe this occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
