By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Our Nation's transportation network provides us with the goods and services we need and the mobility in work and play that we want. 
While our transportation systems have improved in recent years, they can still be made more efficient, accessible, and responsive to the needs of the nation. The Federal Government should take the lead in establishing and carrying out policies to help reduce energy consumption, curtail environmental abuses, and increase competition. 
In recognition of the importance of reliable transportation to our economy and defense, and to encourage continued work on the problems that face our cities, roads, rail, air and water ways, the Congress has requested the President to proclaim annually the third Friday in May as National Defense Transportation Day, and the week in which that day falls as National Transportation Week (71 Stat. 30, 36 U.S.C. 160; 76 Stat. 69, 36 U.S.C. 166). 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, May 20, 1977, as National Defense Transportation Day, and the week beginning May 15, 1977, as National Transportation Week. 
I urge the Governors of our States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Mayor of the District of Columbia, and local officials to issue similar proclamations. I call upon individuals and organizations concerned with transportation, educators, the communications media, and the American people to join with the Department of Transportation in observing this day and week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
