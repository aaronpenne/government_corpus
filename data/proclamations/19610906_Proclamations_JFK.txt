A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the children and youth of today must, in their time, transmit to posterity the values and ideals which have made this Nation great; and 
Whereas
 the preservation of these values and ideals requires renewed dedication to self-discipline and the protection and development of the health of our children in body, mind, and spirit; and 
Whereas
 the observance of a special day emphasizing child health provides an opportunity for a reassessment of the true cultural, spiritual, and social values which will contribute to the total health of our children; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, 45 Stat. 617, as amended by a joint resolution of September 22, 1959, 73 Stat. 627 (36 U.S.C. 143), has requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October as Child Health Day; and 
Whereas
 Child Health Day is also an appropriate time to observe a Universal Children's Day, and to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund are doing to build, better health for children around the world: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, the second day of October 1961, as Child Health Day; and I invite all persons and all agencies and organizations interested in the welfare of children to unite on that day in observances which will assure our children total concepts of health that will bolster their ability to discharge the responsibilities of leadership which will soon be theirs. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK,
