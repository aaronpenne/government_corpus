By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Bill of Rights has served for 180 years as the basic guarantee of the rights and freedoms of the people of the United States. These rights and freedoms are fundamental to the dignity and worth of every person.
The Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the United Nations General Assembly is in the tradition of our Constitution and its Bill of Rights. This Declaration, dating from December 10, 1948, is a statement of principle that represents the hopes of people on every continent, and that provides the nations of the world with a target to strive toward. Both the Bill of Rights and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights rest on the proposition that each person has rights which are his own, and that protection of these rights is the foundation of freedom and justice.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1971, as Human Rights Day and December 15, 1971, as Bill of Rights Day. I call upon the people of the United States of America to observe the week beginning December 10, 1971, as Human Rights Week. In 1971 let us recall the framework of freedom that we established in 1791. Through our commitment to justice and equal opportunity for all in our own nation, we can give strength and meaning to the hopes of the people of all nations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
