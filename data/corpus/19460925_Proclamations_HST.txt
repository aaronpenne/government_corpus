A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski, Polish patriot who came from overseas to fight for the freedom of America, gave his life on October 11, 1779, as a result of wounds received while making a gallant cavalry charge at the siege of Savannah; and
Whereas
 the memory of General Pulaski's supreme contribution to the cause of American liberty has profoundly inspired many thousands of devoted citizens of this land who look to Poland as their ancestral home; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved June 21, 1946 (Public Law 418, 79th Congress), the Congress has authorized me to issue a proclamation designating October 11, 1946, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day for the observance and commemoration of the death of General Pulaski:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 11, 1946, the one hundred and sixty-seventh anniversary of the death of that gallant warrior, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places, and I call upon officials of the Government to have the flag of the United States displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
W. L. CLAYTON,
Acting Secretary of State.
