By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the act of July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, and section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261 (7 U.S.C. 624), the President caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation to determine whether almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, certain programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken; and
2. 
Whereas
 the said Commission instituted such investigation on April 13, 1950, and in the course of such investigation has from time to time reported to the President regarding the need for the imposition of restrictions under the said section 22 in order to prevent imports of tree nuts from rendering ineffective, or materially interfering with, tree-nut programs of the Department of Agriculture; and
3. 
Whereas
 the said Commission reported to the President on September 25, 1952, regarding the need for action under the said section 22 in order to protect tree-nut programs of the Department of Agriculture for the 1952-53 crop year, and the President, on the basis of such report and recommendations made by the said Commission in connection therewith, issued a proclamation on September 27, 1952 (Proclamation 2991; 17 F. R. 8645), carrying out in part the said recommendations; and
4. 
Whereas
, on the basis of the said report of September 25, 1952, and the investigation covered thereby, I find that shelled filberts (whether or not blanched) are practically certain to be imported during the remainder of the 12-month period ending September 30, 1953, in such quantity and under such conditions as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to filberts pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended; and
5. 
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitation hereinafter proclaimed is shown by the investigation of the said Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of imported shelled filberts (whether or not blanched) will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to filberts;
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that no shelled filberts (whether or not blanched) shall be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption hereafter and prior to October 1, 1953, which would permit the total quantity of such filberts entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period October 1, 1952 to September 30, 1953, both dates inclusive, to exceed 4,500,000 pounds, which permissible total quantity I hereby find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 per centum of the average annual total quantity of shelled filberts which were entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period hereinafter mentioned.
I hereby determine that the period October 1, 1949 through September 30, 1951 is a representative period for the purpose of the first proviso to section 22 (b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 10th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
