A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 American farmers are the, most efficient producers of agricultural products the world has ever known; and 
Whereas
 never before in history, has so much food and fiber been produced by so few farmers for so many people throughout this world at so reasonable a cost; and 
Whereas
, because of the initiative and, efficiency of our farmers, most of our people have no need to produce their own food, and, instead, are free to produce the many other, goods and to provide the many services that account for our high standard of living; and 
Whereas
 the consumer's stake in assuring the continuing vitality of our agricultural system becomes more apparent each day as the world's exploding population creates ever increasing demands upon us for food and fiber; and 
Whereas
 the farmer already a major consumer, depends more and more each day upon the products and services of science, labor, and industry to provide him with the modern tools and supplies needed for farm production today; and 
Whereas
 farm and city families should recognize and better understand their interdependence: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 20 through November 26, 1964, as National Farm-City Week; and I call upon people throughout the Nation to participate in the observance of that week. 
I request that leaders of business groups, labor unions, women's clubs, and civic associations, and all consumers join, along with farm families and other rural people, in this observance, as evidence of the strong ties that bind urban and rural Americans. 
I urge the Department of Agriculture, land-grant colleges and universities, the cooperative extension service, and all appropriate Government officials to cooperate with national, State, and local organizations in carrying out programs to observe National Farm-City Week, including public meetings and exhibits and press, radio, and television features. I urge that such programs place special emphasis on the increasing importance of protecting our Nation's soil, water, and timber so that our estimated 340 million citizens of the year 2000 may enjoy abundance then as we do now. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 21st day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
