By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
During the past decade it has become clear that our Nation faces an increasing shortage of its traditional energy sources. This energy shortage and our growing dependence on foreign energy supplies present a serious threat to the national security of the United States and to the health, safety and welfare of its citizens. In an effort to reduce our dependence on foreign energy, we have embarked on a number of programs aimed at the development of new energy technologies. We have also initiated a comprehensive program to educate the Nation, particularly the Nation's youth, about the consequences of the changing world energy supply. 
In order to focus our attention on this ongoing program of energy education for the young?in both public and private schools and at all grade levels?and in an effort to bring together teachers, school officials and parent groups to help our children understand the current international energy situation, Congress has by Joint Resolution (S.J. Res. 43) proclaimed March 21, 1980, as National Energy Education Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all citizens and government officials to observe Friday, March 21, 1980, as National Energy Education Day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I direct all agencies of the Federal Government to cooperate with and participate in the celebration of National Energy Education Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
