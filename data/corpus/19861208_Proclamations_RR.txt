By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation 
More than two million Americans—men, women, and especially children—suffer from a disorder known as alopecia Areata. It is a serious disorder of unknown origin that usually produces small, coin-shaped patches of hair loss on the scalp. In some cases, the disease can progress to the total loss of scalp or body hair. 
Basic research is just beginning to reveal the underlying facts about alopecia Areata. However, new research findings and new approaches to diagnosis and treatment are needed. Working together, the Federal government and private voluntary organizations have developed a strong and enduring partnership committed to research on alopecia areata and other disorders of the skin and its components. Through these efforts, we hope one day to uncover the cause and cure for this distressing disease. 
The Congress, by Public Law 99-524, has designated the week beginning December 7, 1986, as "National Alopecia Areata Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning December 7, 1986, as National Alopecia Areata Awareness Week. I urge the people of the United States and educational, philanthropic, scientific, medical, and health care organizations and professionals to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
