Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that effective immediately a new paragraph (d), reading as follows, is added to section 3 of Proclamation 3279, as amended:
"(d) The Secretary of the Interior shall keep under review the supply-demand situation with respect to asphalt in District I, Districts II-IV, District V, and Puerto Rico, and, as he determines to be consonant with the objectives of this proclamation, he may in his discretion (1) establish, without respect to the levels of imports prescribed in section 2, a maximum level of imports of asphalt for District I, or Districts II–IV, or District V, or Puerto Rico and, notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (4) of paragraph (b) of this section 3, establish a special system of allocation of such imports, or (2) permit the entry for consumption or the withdrawal from warehouse for consumption of asphalt in District I, or Districts II–IV, or District V, or Puerto Rico, without allocations or licenses, notwithstanding the provisions of section 1."
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
