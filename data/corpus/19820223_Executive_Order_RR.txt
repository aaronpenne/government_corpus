By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including Title III of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (19 U.S.C. 2511-2518), and to reflect that the Maritime Administration continues to be one of the agencies to whom the Agreement on Government Procurement is applicable, notwithstanding the transfer of the Maritime Administration from the Department of Commerce to the Department of Transportation (46 U.S.C. 1601), it is hereby ordered that the Annex to Executive Order No. 12260 is amended by adding thereto the following: "54. Maritime Administration of the Department of Transportation.".
