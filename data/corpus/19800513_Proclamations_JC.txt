By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Each year, this Nation sets aside a special day to recognize, honor and celebrate the contributions America's fathers make to the well-being of our families and our society. 
Father's Day is a time for all of us to remember and reflect on the unselfish sacrifices, the support and the guidance our fathers give us?physically, mentally and spiritually. It is a day, too, when we should share with them what they so willingly share with us and display our love and gratitude for the security and strength they provide.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, June 15, 1980, be observed as Father's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
