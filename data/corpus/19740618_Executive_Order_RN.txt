The authority contained in the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, to impose a system of mandatory wage and price controls expired at midnight on April 30, 1974. Executive Order No. 11781 of May 1, 1974, provided for an orderly transition from mandatory controls, for the continuation of enforcement procedures under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, with respect to acts committed prior to May 1, 1974, for the continuation of the Cost of Living Council, and the Continuation of monitoring and other functions of the Council for the period May 1, 1974, through June 30, 1974. However, the orderly termination of the Economic Stabilization Program will require several more months of follow up activities. The Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, permits the maintenance of authority to take appropriate action with respect to any action or pending proceedings, civil or criminal, not finally determined on April 30, 1974, or with respect to matters before the Council that relate to wages paid for work performed prior to May 1, 1974, and prices charged prior to May 1, 1974. In order to meet these requirements and to assure the proper disposition of the files, records, data, and other financial and administrative matters relating to the Economic Stabilization Act, I am, by this Order, delegating to the Secretary of the Treasury such Presidential authority as may remain under the Economic Stabilization Act of 1970, as amended, and assigning to him the responsibility for taking such action as may be necessary and appropriate to achieve the limited objectives described above.
