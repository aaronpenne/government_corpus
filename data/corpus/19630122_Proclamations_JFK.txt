 the United States, as a member of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, is participating with nearly one hundred other countries of the world in the FAO international Freedom-from-Hunger Campaign; and 
Whereas
 the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation has been established to provide citizen leadership for the campaign in the United States; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by Public Law 87-841, approved October 18, 1962, has authorized this Nation, in furtherance of the international Freedom-from-Hunger Campaign, to be host to the World Food Congress from June 4 to 18, 1963; and 
Whereas
 the farmers of this Nation have produced an abundance of food for our own people and for sharing with others; and 
Whereas
 the people of the United States, in sharing our national abundance through their generous support of overseas assistance programs of religious organizations, voluntary agencies, and private groups and foundations, and through Food For Peace and other governmental programs, have demonstrated their concern with the problem of hunger and malnutrition throughout the world; and _ 
Whereas
 there is a need for a rededication of men's minds and hearts to the inspiring possibilities of working together to free the world from hunger: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of March 17 through March 23, 1963, as National Freedom from Hunger Week. 
I ask the American Freedom from Hunger Foundation to take national leadership in planning appropriate observance of this week; and I urge American citizens in all walks of life to participate in the observance of National Freedom from Hunger Week. 
I also ask that all Government departments and agencies which have official responsibilities in the field of food, nutrition, and international relations take appropriate steps to observe, and to cooperate with private groups in observing, National Freedom from Hunger Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
