The attention of the Departments is hereby called to the provisions of the laws giving preference to veterans in appointment and retention.
The President desires that wherever the needs of the service will justify it and the law will permit preference shall be given alike in appointment and retention to honorably discharged veterans of the Civil War, who are fit and well qualified to perform the duties of the places which they seek or are filling.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
