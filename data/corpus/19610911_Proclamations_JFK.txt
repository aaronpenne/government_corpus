By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised the President that he had reason to believe that certain cotton products produced in any stage preceding the spinning into yarn are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof, or to reduce substantially the amount of cotton processed in the United States from cotton or products, thereof with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken; and 
Whereas
, on January 18, 1961, under the authority of the said section 22, the President requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and 
Whereas
, in accordance with the said section 22, as implemented by Executive Order No. 7233 of November 23, 1935, the Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and 
Whereas
, on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that the articles with respect to which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof; and 
Whereas
 I find and declare that the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed are shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of the said articles will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program and other programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to cotton or products thereof: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that the total aggregate quantity of cotton products produced in any stage preceding the spinning into yarn, except cotton wastes, which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any 12-month period, beginning September 11 in 1961 and in subsequent years shall not exceed 1,000 pounds, which permissible total quantity I find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 per centum of the total quantity of such articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period from January 1, 1940, to December 31, 1953, inclusive. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 11th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
DEAN RUSK, 
Secretary of State.
