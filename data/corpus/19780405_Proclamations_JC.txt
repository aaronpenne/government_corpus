By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Proclamation No. 4445, of June 11, 1976, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of November 16, 1976, and Proclamation No. 4509 of June 15, 1977, imposed quantitative restrictions on the importation of certain articles of specialty steels. Section 203(h)(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (4)) permits the President to reduce or terminate any such relief if, after taking into account advice received from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) and after seeking advice from the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, the President determines that the reduction or termination is in the national interest. 
2. I have sought and received advice from the USITC and from the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor concerning the effects of reducing or terminating import relief provided by Proclamation No. 4445, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 and Proclamation No. 4509, on steel provided for in item 923.26 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). I have determined, after considering that advice, that the exclusion of certain steels provided for in item 923.26 of the TSUS, known as chipper knife steel and band saw steel, from such quantitative restrictions is in the national interest. 
3. Accordingly, the purpose of this proclamation is to terminate in part Proclamation No. 4445 of June 11, 1976, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of November 16, 1976, and Proclamation No. 4509 of June 15, 1977, so as to exclude so-called chipper knife steel and band saw steel provided for in item 923.26, TSUS, from the present quantitative restrictions for the remainder of the restraint period which began on June 14, 1977 and the entire restraint period beginning on June 14, 1978, and to make an appropriate reduction in the quota quantities for item 923.26, TSUS, applicable to the European Economic Community and Sweden for the restraint period beginning June 14, 1978 to reflect the exclusion of so-called chipper knife steel and band saw steel. The authority for this action is set forth in section 203 (h) (4) (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (4)), and section 125(b) (19 U.S.C. 2134(b)) of the Trade Act. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 125 and 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135 and 2253, respectively), do proclaim that? 
A. Subpart A, part 2, of the Appendix to the TSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202) is modified as follows: 
(1) by modifying headnote 2(a) (iii) to read as follows: 
"(iii) The term 'alloy tool steel' in item 923.26 refers to alloy steel which contains the following combinations of elements in the quantity, by weight, respectively indicated:

(3) carbon: not less than 0.47 nor more than 0.53 percent; manganese: not less than 0.60 nor more than 0.90 percent; sulfur: none, or not more than 0.015 percent; phosphorus: none, or not more than 0.025 percent; silicon: not less than 0.10 nor more than 0.25 percent; chromium: not less than 0.90 nor more than 1.10 percent; nickel: not less than 0.50 nor more than 0.70 percent; molybdenum: not less than 0.90 nor more than 1.10 percent; vanadium: not less than 0.08 percent nor more than 0.15 percent;" 
(2) by inserting "3,167" and "8,295" in lieu of the existing quota quantities applicable to the European Economic Community and Sweden, respectively, in the quota quantity column headed June 14, 1978, for item 923.26. 
B. The modifications of subpart A of part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS, made by this proclamation, shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after the second day following the date of publication of this proclamation in the FEDERAL REGISTER. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
