A Proclamation
 
TO THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES:
Whereas
 Almighty God, in His infinite wisdom, has taken from us on this day the mortal life of John Foster Dulles; and
Whereas
 this eminent American was a leader in his generation, a champion of righteousness, strong for truth, a builder of good and noble purpose whose eyes were fixed on the highest goals which men are given to see; and
Whereas
 he was a citizen of many achievements in the courts, in the Government of the United States, in the churches and councils of the world, lifting high the banner of freedom and strengthening the cause of justice; and
Whereas
 by his integrity, his sense of duty to country and mankind, his unceasing quest for peace, he earned the regard and respect of all men of good will
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, in grateful tribute to this esteemed statesman, do hereby direct that the appropriate officials arrange for the display of the national flag at half staff on all Government buildings of the United States until the body of John Foster Dulles is laid to rest. I also direct that for the same length of time the representatives of the United States in foreign countries shall make similar arrangements for the display of the flag at half staff over their embassies, legations, consular offices, and military facilities.
From the example of John Foster Dulles, brave in living, brave in dying, let us each hold with all fervor to the verities which inspired him.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
