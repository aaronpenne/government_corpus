By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The high level of competence and dedication of the members of the management profession has contributed significantly to the success of the American economy. Management skills are particularly important at the present time because of the need for increased productivity to allow our goods and services to compete more successfully in both domestic and world markets. We urge those with management responsibilities to continue to improve their skills. 
It is important that we acknowledge the essential role of management in ensuring the strength of the American economy, both in the past and for the future. We hope that public recognition of the vital role managerial personnel play in furthering the goals of our society will encourage and inspire young Americans to consider management as a career. 
In recognition of the essential role of this profession in ensuring the continued strength of the American economy, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 225, has designated the week beginning on June 5, 1983, as "Management Week in America" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 5, 1983, as Management Week in America and call upon the American people to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 17th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
