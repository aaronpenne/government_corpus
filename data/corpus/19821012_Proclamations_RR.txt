By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Ocean, Great Lakes, and inland river ports and terminals are among our most important national assets. They have contributed substantially to the shaping of our early history as a Nation and fostered the industry and trade which helped build many of America's great cities. 
Today our ports are vital links in the total transportation system which serves this Nation's domestic and international trade. Their continued development is indispensable to our economic and military security. In 1981 port industry handled over two billion short tons of waterborne commerce in foreign and domestic trade; added $6.5 billion to the United States Treasury from U.S. Customs Service collections; and contributed over $35 billion to the gross national product and over $1.5 billion to the balance of payments accounts. 
To meet the needs of expanding waterborne commerce, billions of dollars have been invested in new and expanded facilities by non-Federal entities representing State and local authorities and private industry. 
In recognition of the importance of our ports to the Nation's economy, security, and welfare, the Congress has, by Joint Resolution, designated the first week in October 1982 as "National Port Week." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the seven calendar days beginning October 3, 1982, as "National Port Week." I invite the Governors of the several States, the chief officials of local governments, and the people of the United States to observe this with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
