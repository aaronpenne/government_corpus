A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the pioneers of our Nation established schools and colleges and regarded education as a bulwark of the American way of life; and
Whereas
 the Nation's schools and educational institutions have contributed immeasurably to the welfare of our people and to the progress and security of our country; and
Whereas
 education contributes not only to the development of a fuller and more useful life for the individual citizen but also to the safeguarding of the freedoms and ideals which we cherish as Americans; and
Whereas
 in this year of the White House Conference on Education our people have a right to take special pride in our Nation's educational system, and an obligation to demonstrate a desire and capacity to meet the major problems facing American education:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 6 through November 12, 1955, as American Education Week, and I ask the people throughout the country to participate fully in the observance of that week. I urge this observance as evidence of appreciation to teachers and school officials for work well done, and as a pledge of citizen interest in better education. I also urge this observance as a fitting prelude to the White House Conference on Education to be held in the City of Washington from November 28 through December 1, 1955, and as a tribute to the challenging role American education is playing in building a better and stronger nation in today's world of nations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
HERBERT HOOVER, Jr.,
Acting Secretary of State
