By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 3347 of title 5 of the United States Code and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. During any period when by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, neither the Secretary of the Interior nor the Under Secretary of the Interior is available to exercise the powers or perform the duties of the office of Secretary, an Assistant Secretary of the Interior or the Solicitor of the Department of the Interior, in such order as the Secretary of the Interior may from time to time prescribe, shall act as Secretary. If no such order of succession is in effect at that time, they shall act as Secretary in the order in which they shall have taken office as Assistant Secretaries or Solicitor.
SEC. 2. This order supersedes Executive Order No. 10753 of February 15, 1958, entitled "Designation of certain officers of the Department of the Interior to act as Secretary of the Interior."
