By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In a civilization marred by disputes and conflicts, the ministers of God, representing all faiths, help lead the human family to an understanding of His love and His peace. Clergymen of all denominations point the way to a richer, more fulfilling life through higher moral standards. 
The clergy inspire all of us to hold firm to what is right--against what is wrong. They call upon us to practice charity and compassion. They bring us together and nearer to our Creator. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in recognition of the spiritual and social contributions of the clergy in our Country and throughout the world, do hereby proclaim the week beginning January 30, 1977, as International Clergy Week in the United States. I urge all our people to honor these servants of God and man through appropriate activities and ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first. 
JIMMY CARTER
