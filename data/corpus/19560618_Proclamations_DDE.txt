By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, by joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress of the United States has designated the 17th day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of all our citizens who have come of age and all who have been naturalized during the year; and
Whereas
 with the passing of the years the basic soundness and the durability of the principles embodied in our Constitution become increasingly evident; and
Whereas
 the test of time has served to strengthen our pride and belief in the greatness of our country and has inspired us to an ever firmer determination that the carrying out of the responsibilities of citizenship, as well as the exercise of its rights and privileges, shall play an important role in our daily lives; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid resolution authorizes the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day with appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Monday, September 17, 1956, and urge the people of the Nation to display the flag on that day at their homes and other suitable places.
I also urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as religious, civic, patriotic, educational, and other organizations, to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on Citizenship Day through which all our people may gain a deeper appreciation of the great heritage secured to us by the Constitution and come to have a better understanding of our rights and responsibilities as citizens of the United States.
And I also call upon all our citizens to renew and reaffirm their fealty on that day to the principles embodied in the Constitutionâ€”the foundation of our free and independent Republic.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 18th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
