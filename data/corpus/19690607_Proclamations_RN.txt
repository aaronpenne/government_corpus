By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Photography is one of the most versatile tools in the service of mankind.
In addition to photography's traditional role of memorializing the lives, the work, and the culture of our people, it plays an important part in education, industry, commerce, and the sciences.
More than 150,000 men and women are engaged in this profession, contributing over a billion dollars to our economy.
But photography is more than a pleasurable hobby or a commercial medium; it is a universal language which demonstrates that people throughout the world share many of the same problems and the same aspirations. As a means of communication, it makes a substantial contribution to world understanding and progress.
As a tribute to the importance of professional photography in American life, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 77, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period beginning June 8, 1969, and ending June 14, 1969, as Professional Photography Week in America.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of June 8 through June 14, 1969, as Professional Photography Week in America; and I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
