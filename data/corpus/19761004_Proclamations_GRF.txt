By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
By Proclamation No. 4463 of September 21, 1976, the President modified Proclamation No. 4334 of November 16, 1974, by establishing new rates of duty applicable to certain sugars, sirups, and molasses described in item numbers 155.20 and 155.30 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS" (19 U.S.C. 1202). Proclamation No. 4963 is effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after September 21, 1976. 
Taking into account the factors cited in Proclamation No. 4463, and in order to alleviate hardships which may result from increasing the rate of duty with respect to certain goods that were exported prior to the effective date of that Proclamation, I find it appropriate to amend Proclamation No. 4463 to permit articles that were imported to the United States before the effective date of that Proclamation and that are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption within a reasonable time following exportation, to continue to be dutiable at the rates provided in Proclamation No. 4334 of November 16, 1974. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including Section 201(a) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2) ), and in conformity with Headnote 2, Subpart A of Part 10 of Schedule 1 of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim that paragraph C of Proclamation No. 4463 of September 21, 1976, is hereby amended to read as follows: 
"C. The Provisions of this Proclamation shall become effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after September 21, 1976, and shall remain in effect until the President otherwise proclaims or until otherwise superseded by law. However, the provisions of this Proclamation shall not be effective with respect to articles exported to the United State s before 12:01 A.M. (U.S. Eastern Daylight Savings Time), September 21, 1976, provided that such articles are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or before November 8, 1976." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first. 
GERALD R. FORD
