By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 301 (a) and (f) of title 37, United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered that Executive Order No. 11157 of June 22, 1964, be, and it is hereby, amended by adding to section 109 of Part I the following new subsection:
"(f) The term 'duty involving frequent and regular participation in flight operations on the flight deck of an aircraft carrier' shall be construed to mean duty performed by members who are designated for and ordered to such duty by competent authority from among the crew of an attack aircraft carrier, an antisubmarine aircraft carrier, or an aviation unit operating from either such type of carrier, and who in any calendar month (1) participate in flight operations on the flight deck during a minimum of four days or (2) participate on the flight deck, in the minimum number of aircraft launches or recoveries, or both, that is prescribed by the Secretary of the Navy as the equivalent of participation under clause (1). No member shall be entitled, however, to receive the pay provided for in this subsection if, during any month or portion thereof, he is also eligible to receive incentive pay for other hazardous duty under the provisions of section 301 of title 37, United States Code."
