A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Christopher Columbus four hundred and seventy-three years ago journeyed westward across forbidding and unknown seas to open the way for the eventual establishment of our Nation and its free institutions; and
Whereas
 the compelling drive of Columbus to seek new horizons has been an inspiration through the centuries to millions with the same enterprising spirit; and
Whereas
 the persistence and daring of Columbus has left a heritage which sustains us now as we explore the unknown reaches of outer space; and
Whereas
 the Congress, in recognition of our indebtedness to Christopher Columbus, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 12, 1965, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of Christopher Columbus.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on Columbus Day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
