A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Christopher Columbus, after sailing many weeks on a vast and unknown sea, found a western continent and a new world on October 12, 1492; and 
Whereas
 the daring and resolution of this man of destiny have encouraged in every generation the perseverance of those who seek the truth beyond the horizon; and
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, mindful of the rich heritage left us by Christopher Columbus, provided, by a resolution approved on April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), that the anniversary of his epochal discovery should be commemorated each year:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 12, 1952, as Columbus Day, and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in their homes, their schools, and their churches, or in other suitable places. I direct the officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on October 12 in honor of the man whose discovery gave democracy a new birthplace.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
