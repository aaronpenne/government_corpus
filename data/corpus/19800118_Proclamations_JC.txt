By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to sections 406(c), 202, and 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2436(c), 2252 and 2253), I hereby find that there are reasonable grounds to believe, with respect to imports of anhydrous ammonia from the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (U.S.S.R.) provided for in items 417.22 and 480.65 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), that market disruption exists with respect to articles produced by a domestic industry and that emergency action is necessary. 
2. Recent events have altered the international economic conditions under which I made my determination that it was not in the national interest to impose import relief on anhydrous ammonia from the U.S.S.R. as recommended by the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) on October 11, 1979. However, the factual basis upon which USITC made its determination of market disruption still exists. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 604, 406 (c), 202 and 203 of the. Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483, 2436(c), 2252, and 2253), do proclaim that? 
(1) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(2) This proclamation shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the third day following the date of publication of this Proclamation in the FEDERAL REGISTER and shall remain in effect for one year unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly suspended, modified or terminated, but in any event not longer than authorized by section 406 (c) of the Trade Act. 
(3) The Commissioner of Customs shall take such action as the U.S. Trade Representative shall direct in the implementation and administration of the import relief herein proclaimed. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
