By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
There is no better way for this Nation to invest in its future than by fostering the' health of its children. We can best do this by encouraging children to develop good health habits and attitudes and by giving them the protection of immunization. Good health habits and practices begun in childhood are the prelude to positive health throughout life. 
Healthy children foreshadow vigorous adults whose communities will benefit from their energy and productivity. All of us should know how the personal choices we make can help prevent disease and promote good health and to transfer this knowledge to our children. By working together, parents, schools, private and voluntary organizations, and government can effect a beneficial and lasting change in the health of our Nation and the lives of our children. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), do hereby proclaim Monday, October 4, 1982, as Child Health Day. 
I urge all Americans to join me in encouraging good health habits and attitudes in our children and call upon all citizens to Observe Child Health Day with appropriate activities directed toward establishing such practices in the youth of our Country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 14th day of Sept. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
