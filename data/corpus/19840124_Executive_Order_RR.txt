By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States and by Chapter 47 of Title 10 of the United States Code (the Uniform Code of Military Justice), in order to prescribe amendments to the Manual for Courts-Martial, United States, 1969 (Revised edition), prescribed by Executive Order No. 11476, as amended by Executive Order No. 11835, Executive Order No. 12018, Executive Order No. 12198, Executive Order No. 12233, Executive Order No. 12306, Executive Order No. 12315, Executive Order No. 12340, and Executive Order No. 12383, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Paragraph 75 of the said
Manual for Courts-Martial is amended by adding, after paragraph 75f, the following:
"g. Capital cases.
"(1) In general. Death may be adjudged only when:
"(a) Death is expressly authorized under the code and this Manual for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty or is authorized under the law of war for an offense of which the accused has been found guilty under the law of war; and 
"(b) The requirements of 75g (2) and (3) have been met. 
"(2) Procedure. In addition to the other provisions in 75, the following procedures shall apply in capital casesâ€” 
"(a) Notice. Before arraignment, trial counsel shall give the defense written notice of which aggravating circumstances under 75g(3) the prosecution intends to prove. Failure to provide timely notice under this subsection of any aggravating circumstances under 75g(3) shall not bar later notice and proof of such additional aggravating circumstances unless the accused demonstrates specific prejudice from such failure and that a continuance or a recess is not an adequate remedy. 
"(b) Evidence of aggravating circumstances. Trial counsel may present evidence in accordance with 75b(4) tending to establish one or more of the aggravating circumstances in 75g(3). 
"(c) Evidence in extenuation and mitigation. The accused shall be given broad latitude to present evidence in extenuation and mitigation. 
"(d) Necessary findings. Death may not be adjudged unless the members find: 
"(i) Beyond a reasonable doubt that one or more of the aggravating circumstances under 75g(3) existed; and 
"(ii) That any extenuating or mitigating circumstances are substantially outweighed by any aggravating circumstances including such circumstances under 75g(3) as the members have found existed. 
"(e) Basis for findings. The findings in 75g(2)(d) may be based on evidence introduced before the findings on the issue of guilt, during the sentencing proceeding, or both. 
"(f) Instructions. In addition to the instructions required under 76b(1), the military judge shall instruct the members on such aggravating circumstances under 75g(3) as may be in issue in the case and on the requirements and procedures under 75g(2)(d), (e), (g), and (h). The military judge shall instruct the members that they must consider all evidence in extenuation and mitigation before they may adjudge death. 
"(g) Voting. In closed session, before voting on a sentence, the members shall vote by secret written ballot separately on each aggravating circumstance under 75g(3) on which they have been instructed. Death may not be adjudged unless all members concur in a finding of the existence of at least one such aggravating circumstance. After voting on all the circumstances on which they have been instructed, the members shall vote on a sentence in accordance with 76b(2) and (3). 
"(h) Announcement. If death is adjudged, the president shall, in addition to complying with 76c, announce which aggravating circumstances under 75g(3) were found by the members. 
"(3) Aggravating circumstances. Death may be adjudged only if the members find, beyond a reasonable doubt, one or more of the following aggravating circumstances: 
"(a) That the offense was committed before or in the presence of the enemy, except that this circumstance shall not apply in the case of a violation of Article 118 or 120; 
"(b) That in committing the offense the accused intended to: 
"(i) cause substantial damage to the national security of the United States; or

"(c) That the offense caused substantial damage to the national security of the United States, whether or not the accused intended such damage, except that this circumstance shall not apply in the case of a violation of Article 118 or 120;
