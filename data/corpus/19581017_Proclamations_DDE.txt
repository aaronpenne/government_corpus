A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the people of this Nation are deeply conscious of our obligation to the veterans of our armed services, who have contributed immeasurably to the realization of those ideals of a free society which we cherish; and
Whereas
 it is fitting and proper that on one special day each year we should give nationwide expression to our high and enduring esteem for these veterans; and
Whereas
 the Congress by an Act approved June 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 168), expanded the significance of November 11, theretofore declared a legal holiday and observed as Armistice Day, by designating it as Veterans Day in honor of our veterans:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon our citizens to observe Tuesday, November 11, 1958, as Veterans Day. On that day let us pay tribute to the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces, and let us rededicate ourselves to the preservation of our freedom and our way of life, which these veterans have so valiantly defended.
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 17th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
