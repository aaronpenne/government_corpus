By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Congress of the United States has set aside the first day of May as Law Day, U.S.A.
This year will mark the Nation's thirteenth annual observance of Law Dayâ€”a special day for reaffirming our loyalty to the United States and rededicating ourselves to the rule of law.
The benefits that have come to each of us as individuals and to all of us as Americans through our adherence to the rule of law are endless. It is through the processes of law that our Nation has achieved its amazing growth and development in every sphere of human endeavor.
The law does not rule by itself. Citizens administer it; and each citizen must abide by its constraints and accept its responsibilities if the rights, freedoms, opportunities and protections of all citizens are to be guarded.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Friday, May 1, 1970, as Law Day in the United States of America with appropriate public ceremonies and by rededication to our form of government and to the supremacy of law in our lives. Especially, I urge the legal profession, the schools and educational institutions, civic and service organizations, all media of public information, and the courts to take the lead in sponsoring and participating in appropriate observances throughout the Nation.
And, as requested by the Congress, I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
