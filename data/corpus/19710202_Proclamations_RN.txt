By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On February 4, 1971, the United Service Organizations, affectionately known as the USO, will celebrate its thirtieth anniversary.
Its exclusive mission, since its beginning prior to World War II, has been to serve the morale, spiritual, recreational, and entertainment needs of the Armed Forces.
In war and peace the USO, with its thousands of patriotic volunteers, has kept the faith with millions of Americans as they have been called into the service of their nation.
Neither asking for nor receiving any financial support from the Government, the USO has been described as an expression of the continuing concern of Main Street America for its sons and daughters in uniform, wherever they serve.
For the past three decades, the American people have voluntarily given their support, both financial and personal, to bolster the morale of our servicemen and women through the operation of the USO. It continues to give an answer to the two questions always on the minds of the young men and women in uniform, "Does anyone know I'm here?" and "Does anyone care?".
Over the years, the USO has continued to give a resounding "Yes" on behalf of all thoughtful Americans.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 4, 1971, as USO Day, and urge the people of the United States to give their enthusiastic support to the United Service Organizations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 2nd day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
