That from and after February 1, 1922, the coastwise laws of the United States shall extend to the island Territories and possessions of the United States not now covered thereby, and the board [United States Shipping Board] is directed prior to the expiration of such year to have established adequate steamship service at reasonable rates to accommodate the commerce and the passenger travel of said islands and to maintain and operate such service until it can be taken over and operated and maintained upon satisfactory terms by private capital and enterprise: Provided, That if adequate shipping service is not established by February 1, 1922, the President shall extend the period herein allowed for the establishment of such service in the case of any island Territory or possession for such time as may be necessary for the establishment of adequate shipping facilities therefore * * *;
and
Whereas
 the authority of the United States Shipping Board was vested in the Department of Commerce pursuant to section 12 of the President's Executive order of June 10, 1933; and
Whereas
 section 204 of the Act of June 29, 1936 (49 Stat. 1987) transferred such authority to the United States maritime Commission; and
Whereas
 this authority was transferred to the Secretary of Commerce by section 204 of the reorganization plan number 21 of 1950; and
Whereas
 an adequate shipping service to accommodate the commerce and the passenger travel of Canton Island has not been established as provided in the aforesaid section; and 
Whereas
 the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island, as provided in the aforesaid section, is dependent upon the establishment of such adequate shipping service; and
Whereas
 by various proclamations the period for the establishment of an adequate shipping service for Canton Island was extended to January 1, 1953, and the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to the Island was deferred to that date:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 21 of the aforesaid Merchant Marine Act, 1920, do hereby declare and proclaim that the period for the establishment of an adequate shipping service for Canton Island is further extended to January 1, 1958, and that the extension of the coastwise laws of the United States to Canton Island is further deferred to January 1, 1958.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
