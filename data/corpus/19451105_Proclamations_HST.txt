A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the battle flags of World War I were sheathed by the armistice of November 11, 1918; and
Whereas
 it is fitting at this time when we are honoring the heroes of a more recent world conflict that we express once more our gratitude for the sacrifices of those who fought in World War I; and
Whereas
 Senate Concurrent Resolution 18, Sixty-ninth Congress, passed June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), requests the President of the United States to issue a proclamation calling for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on November 11 and for the observance of the day with ceremonies "expressive of our gratitude for peace and our desire for the continuance of friendly relations with all other peoples"; and an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), provides that "the 11th day of November in each year, a day to be dedicated to the cause of world peace and to be hereafter celebrated and known as Armistice Day, is hereby made a legal public holiday":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe November 11, 1945, as Armistice Day by recalling the valor and the sacrifices of those Americans who brought victory in 1918, and by dedicating themselves to the building of an enduring peace among the countries of the world; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this fifth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES F. BYRNES,
