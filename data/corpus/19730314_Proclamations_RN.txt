A Proclamation
 
In today's rapidly changing, highly mobile society, more children than ever find themselves temporarily, or even permanently, separated from their parents. Such children may carry lasting emotional scars unless they can be placed in a stable family environment where they can feel loved and secure.
In the past year alone, more than 300,000 American children were living in foster homes. It is gratifying that so many Americans are working to help foster children. They include not only professionals in the child welfare field but hundreds of volunteers—businessmen, church and community leaders, and members of civic groups—all dedicated to the principle that bone of our children should be deprived or neglected.
In recognition of these efforts, I am asking the Nation to set aside a week during which we can assess the needs of foster children, encourage States and communities to plan activities which will help meet those needs, and renew our determination to assure foster children that we care about them and their well-being.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of April 8 through April 14, 1973, as National Action for Foster Children Week, 1973.
I urge Governors and Mayors to join me in proclaiming this observance, and I earnestly call upon citizens everywhere to volunteer their talents, energies and compassion in behalf of foster children, so that they may enjoy the sound development that comes from a full and happy family life.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 14th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
