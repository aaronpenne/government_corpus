A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 children are our Nation's most priceless resource and most cherished responsibility; and 
Whereas
 it is essential that boys and girls of our Nation be given a good start in life by the fostering of their emotional, physical, and spiritual well-being so that in future years each may achieve his full potential for a productive and satisfying life; and 
Whereas
 the observance of a special day emphasizing child health effectively underscores these goals; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution of May 18, 1928, 45 Stat. 617, as amended by a joint resolution of September 22, 1959, 73 Stat. 627 (36 U.S.C. 143), requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October as Child Health Day; and 
Whereas
 Child Health Day is also an appropriate time to observe a Universal Children's Day, and to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund are doing to build better health for children around the world: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, the first day of October 1962, as Child Health Day; and I invite all persons and all agencies and organizations interested in the welfare of children to unite on that day in observances that will underscore the importance of providing opportunities for our children at the beginning of life that will insure healthy development through the years. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
