By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In this the birth month of Thomas Jefferson, author of the first American manual on parliamentary practice, it is fitting that we reflect upon the importance of parliamentary procedure in the meetings of our private and public organizations. These procedures protect individual rights and majority rule and they assure orderly deliberation. 
The Congress of the United States has, by Senate Joint Resolution 102, authorized and requested the President to designate the month of April, 1982, as Parliamentary Emphasis Month. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of April, 1982, as Parliamentary Emphasis Month and call upon Federal, State, and local government agencies and the people of the United States to observe the month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities, and I urge them to promote democratic processes and efficient organization of meetings through parliamentary practice. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
