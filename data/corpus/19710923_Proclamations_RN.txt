By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The strength and energy of a society may be measured today and predicted for tomorrow by the health of its children. Robust bodies, bright eyes, sharp minds: all of these define the quality of life in this country now and for the future.
Caring for the health of our 70 million citizens under eighteen and the nearly four million babies born each year is not merely a choice for today, but also a duty to tomorrow.
All our children deserve to be free from preventable sickness and handicaps. If they suffer illness or handicap, they should have the best care possible.
We need to insure that parents are helped to bear healthy babies; that infants receive optimal care; that the health of the children is protected and enhanced during the growing years; that abnormalities of development are prevented or ameliorated.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, pursuant to a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), do hereby designate Monday, October 4, 1971, as Child Health Day.
I invite all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to unite upon that day in such activities as will awaken the people of the Nation to the fundamental necessity of a year-round program for the protection and development of the health of the Nation's children.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
