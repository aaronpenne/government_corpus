By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
There are few things in life more delightful than the sight of healthy childrenâ€”enjoying their youth and looking forward to a long and fulfilling life. One of our most important national responsibilities is the assurance of full and healthy development for the children of America.
Parents, of course, have the primary responsibility for the health of their children and the home is the greatest single influence on child development. But the responsibility for child health is also shared by a wide range of the institutions which help meet children's needs. In a sense, almost everything we do as a people to foster better social, economic and environmental conditions can have an impact for good on the health of the American child.
Each year since 1928, we have set aside one day as Child Health Day to recognize the enormity of our individual and national responsibility and to reaffirm our commitment to child health.
By joint resolution of May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), the Congress requested the President to issue annually a proclamation declaring the first Monday in October as Child Health Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, October 1, 1973, as Child Health Day. I invite all citizens, agencies and organizations concerned with child health to join in such activities as will help alert all Americans to the vital importance of improving child health.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
