By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Americans enjoy a multitude of sports and recreational activities that serve to refresh the body and spirit. For many of our citizens, recreation means boating. 
Those involved in recreational boating should always remember that the primary responsibility for safety rests with the individual. And while a cruise can be a wonderful experience for one person or an entire family, it can also result in tragedy. 
Aware of the need for boating safety, the Congress enacted the joint resolution of June 4, 1958 (36 U.S.C. 161) as amended, requesting that the President proclaim a National Safe Boating Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning on June 7, 1981 as National Safe Boating Week. 
All Americans who utilize our waterways for recreation should possess at least a minimum knowledge of safety afloat. I urge all Americans who engage in recreational boating to take advantage of the numerous safe boating courses sponsored by governmental and private organizations. I particularly urge inexperienced operators of small boats to enroll in these safety and educational programs. Learning the fundamentals of safe boating can do nothing but add to the potential pleasure and excitement of recreational boating. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, Puerto Rico, the Northern Mariana Islands, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 4th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
