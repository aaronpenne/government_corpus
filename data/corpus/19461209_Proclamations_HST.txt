By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 15, 1946, marks the one hundred and fifty-fifth anniversary of the adoption of the Bill of Rights; and
Whereas
 that covenant, which was written into our Constitution by the first ten amendments, guarantees to the American people freedom of religion, freedom of speech and assembly, and freedom to petition for the redress of grievances; and
Whereas
 the preservation of these inestimable privileges can be guaranteed only by courage, determination, and unremitting vigilance; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we should set aside a day for solemn contemplation of our liberties and of the recent world-wide battle to protect them from annihilation:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to a joint resolution of the Congress approved May 29, 1946, do hereby designate December 15, 1946, as Bill of Rights Day. And I call upon the officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day; and urge the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies and prayer at their homes. In schools, and in places of congregation and of worship.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
