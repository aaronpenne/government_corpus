By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
This year we mark the beginning of our third century as an independent nation. Two hundred years ago our Declaration of Independence declared that "all men are created equal." It did not say "all Americans" but embraced all men everywhere. Throughout our history we have repeatedly demonstrated our conviction and concerns that men and women throughout the world should share the full blessings of liberty. 
As we celebrate our Bicentennial, it is important that we let the world know that America still cares, that the torch in the Statue of Liberty still burns brightly. The world should know that we stand for freedom and independence in 1976, just as we stood for freedom and independence in 1776. 
For two centuries, the fundamental basis of American policy toward other nations has remained unchanged: the United States supports the aspirations for freedom, independence and national self-determination of all peoples. We do not accept foreign domination over any nation. We reaffirm today this principle and policy. 
The Eighty-Sixth Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), authorized and requested the President to proclaim the third week in July of each year as Captive Nations Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 18, 1976 as Captive Nations Week. 
I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge rededication to the aspirations of all peoples for self-determination and liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
