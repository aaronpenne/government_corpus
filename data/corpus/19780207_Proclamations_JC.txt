By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American Red Cross is serving the needs of the American people now, as it has served them for nearly a century. Although its programs and services have grown in scope as well as in size over the years, the relief of human suffering remains its fundamental purpose. Throughout its proud history, its spirit of volunteerism has been the source of its strength. 
It is the Red Cross' volunteer?our neighbor?who helps ease the suffering of disaster victims; who teaches us first aid, water safety, and proper care of the ill and injured; who instills in our young people those qualities of leadership that will mean so much to this Nation in later years; who donates the blood that gives renewed life to the sick; and who comes to the assistance of the men and women of our armed forces, and to veterans and their families. 
March has traditionally been observed as Red Cross Month. It is a time for concerned people to address their thoughts to those qualities of compassion, understanding and selflessness which identify the Red Gross spirit of volunteerism. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1978, as Red Cross Month. I urge all Americans to give generous support to the work of their local Red Cross chapter. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
