By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American family has been the most resilient, dynamic force in the growth and development of our Nation. Yet its influence is so subtle that we tend to take for granted the vital functions it performs as the source of love, support, and guidance, the wellspring of courage, determination and inspiration. 
National Family Week gives us a chance to highlight the special contributions and needs of the family, to acknowledge the new challenges that American families now face, and to act on the many significant recommendations generated by the White House Conference on Families. 
It is a time to seek ways to strengthen and support the family?a time to renew the realization that the fundamental integrity and vitality of the Nation relies on the underlying health of the American family. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with Senate Joint Resolution 156, do hereby request that the week of November 23, 1980, be designated National Family Week and call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate activities in their communities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
JIMMY CARTER
