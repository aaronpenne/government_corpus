By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the following-named international organizations pursuant to a treaty or under the authority of an act of Congress authorizing such participation or making an appropriation therefor I hereby designate them as public international organizations entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said Act:
Intergovernmental Committee on Refugees, International Wheat Advisory Committee (International Wheat Council).
The designation of the above organizations as public international organizations within the meaning of the said International Organization Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges and immunities which such organizations may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
This order supplements Executive Orders No. 9698 of February 19, 1946, and No. 9751 of July 11, 1946.
