The board shall then retire to consider the record.

(a) When the board has sufficiently examined the evidence, the presiding officer shall put the question upon each specification of each charge, beginning with the first, whether the specification is "proved," "not proved," or "proved in part."

When a majority of the board agrees upon a finding it shall be so recorded.
(b) When the members have voted upon all the specifications of an charge the question shall be put upon the charge to each member, "Is the accused guilty of this charge, or not guilty?" When a majority decision is arrived at, the result shall be recorded. The board shall then proceed to the next charge and specifications until votes have been taken and decisions recorded upon all the charges and specifications.
(c) When the members of the board have voted upon all the charges, if the accused has been found guilty upon any of them the members shall proceed to vote upon the punishment to be recommended. Each member shall write down the punishment which he believes should be recommended and shall hand his vote to the presiding officer, who shall announce the result. If a majority shall not have agreed upon the nature and degree of the punishment to be recommended, the chairman shall proceed, beginning with the mildest punishment that has been proposed and continuing, if necessary, to the next more severe punishment, and so on, successively, until a punishment to be recommended has been decided upon by a majority of the members of the board.
(d) A finding of guilty shall not be entered on a charge other than a charge specified. In case evidence develops which in the opinion of the Service representative warrants additional charges and specifications, appropriate recommendation shall be made with respect thereto by the Service representative to the Surgeon General. The Service representative shall give due notice to the presiding officer, whereupon the board shall await further instructions from the Surgeon General.
SEC. 2.312 Findings and recommendations of board. After all charges and specifications have been voted upon, the recorder, under the direction of the board, shall draw up the findings, specifying as to each charge whether the accused has been found guilty or not guilty, and, on approval by the board, shall enter such findings upon the record, together with the recommendations of the board as to punishment and clemency if the accused has been found guilty of any charge.
SEC. 2.313 Recommendations of board. (a) In arriving at its recommendations as to the nature and degree of the punishment, if any, to be imposed, the board shall take into consideration all previous convictions and the official record of the accused. If mitigating circumstances have appeared during the proceedings which could not be taken into consideration in determining the degree of guilt found by the verdict, the board may avail itself of such circumstances as grounds for recommending clemency. Any recommendation for clemency shall be inserted immediately after the recommendation as to punishment.
SEC. 2.314 Report to accompany record. The board shall prepare a report to accompany the record and in such report shall review the evidence as a whole, with specific reference to all evidence and to any conclusions of law on controverted questions upon which the findings are based. The report of the board shall be signed by the members concurring; any member or members not concurring, in whole or in part, may submit and sign a minority report.
SEC. 2.315 Transmittal of record and report. After the record (including the transcript of the testimony) and other documents have been signed, they shall be forwarded by the presiding officer to the Surgeon General. The board shall then adjourn pending further orders.
