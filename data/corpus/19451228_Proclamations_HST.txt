A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is fitting that we honor the memory of George Washington Carver who contributed to the expansion of the agricultural economy of the nation through his diligent research as an agricultural chemist; and
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved December 28, 1945 (Public Law 290, 79th Congress), the Congress has designated January 5, 1946 as George Washington Carver Day and has authorized and requested me "to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on such day":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon officials of the Government to have the flag of the United States displayed on all Government buildings on January 5, 1946 in commemoration of the achievements of George Washington Carver.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth.
