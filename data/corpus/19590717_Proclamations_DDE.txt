A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 many nations throughout the world have been made captive by the imperialistic and aggressive policies of Soviet communism; and
Whereas
 the peoples of the Soviet-dominated nations have been deprived of their national independence and their individual liberties; and
Whereas
 the citizens of the United States are linked by bonds of family and principle to those who love freedom and justice on every continent; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate and proper to manifest to the peoples of the captive nations the support of the Government and the people of the United States of America for their just aspirations for freedom and national independence; and
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved July 17, 1959, the Congress has authorized and requested the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation designating the third week in July 1959 as "Captive Nations Week," and to issue a similar proclamation each year until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 19, 1959, as Captive Nations Week.
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to study the plight of the Soviet-dominated nations and to recommit themselves to the support of the just aspirations of the peoples of those captive nations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
