A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the transportation industry is one of our Nation's most important industries and affects our economic, political, and social development; and 
Whereas
 an effective transportation system is an essential element of our national defense; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate that recognition be given to the American transportation system, the development and maintenance of which has contributed so extensively to the growth, culture, and prosperity of our people in peaceful trade and world commerce and in effective logistic support of our armed forces; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President annually to issue a proclamation designating the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day and urging the people of the United States-including labor, management, users, and investors in all communities served by any of the various forms of transportation by land, by water, and by air to observe this occasion by appropriate ceremonies: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America., do hereby designate Friday, May 18, 1962, as National Defense Transportation Day, and I urge our people to join in the observance of this day, in cooperation with the transportation industry and representatives of the armed forces and other governmental agencies, and to participate in the observance of this occasion by appropriate ceremonies. 
I also invite the Governors of the States to provide for the observance of National Defense Transportation Day in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the citizens of each community to recognize and appreciate fully the vital role of a great modern transportation system in their daily lives and in our national defense. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
