A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the employment of physically handicapped workers has materially increased in 1959 as compared with 1958; and
Whereas
 there is every indication that the coming year will show a continuing increase in economic activity and, therefore, a proportionate increase in the demand for qualified workers who have overcome their physical handicaps; and
Whereas
 the expanding national program to develop maximum employment opportunities for the physically handicapped is continuing to attract the interest of additional thousands of dedicated volunteers in national, State, and community committees who are working wholeheartedly with public and private agencies for the rehabilitation and employment of handicapped persons; and
Whereas
 there is an increasing awareness among employers, fellow employees, and the public of the abilities of handicapped men and women as skilled, stable, and efficient workers; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 4, 1959, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. I also urge our citizens to remember, throughout the year, that by their interest and efforts many handicapped persons can be assisted to economic independence and active participation in a productive way of life.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
