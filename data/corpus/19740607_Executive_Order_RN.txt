By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 6103 (a) and 6106 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, as amended (26 U.S.C. 6103 (a), 6106), it is hereby ordered that the Committee on the Judiciary, House of Representatives, or any duly authorized subcommittee thereof is authorized, in connection with House Resolution 803, authorizing and directing an investigation to determine whether grounds exist for the House of Representatives to exercise its constitutional power to impeach Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States of America, to inspect all tax returns of President Nixon for the years 1969 through 1972, including other records, reports, information received orally or in writing, factual data, documents, papers, abstracts, memoranda, or evidence relating to such returns. Whenever a return is open to inspection by such Committee or subcommittee, a copy thereof shall, upon request, be furnished to such Committee or subcommittee. Such inspection shall be in accordance and upon compliance with the rules and regulations prescribed by the Secretary of the Treasury in Treasury Decision 6132, relating to the inspection of returns by committees of the Congress, approved by the President on May 3, 1955.
