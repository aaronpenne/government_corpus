A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on October 23, 1946, the United Nations will convene in General Assembly at the seat of that organization in this country; and
Whereas
 weighty and urgent problems, left in the wake of a devastating war and imposed by the need to establish an enduring peace, demand from the United Nations an unprecedented measure of understanding and good will; and
Whereas
 schools, colleges, universities, and other educational institutions are powerful weapons against the ignorance and ill will that produce those misunderstandings and conflicts which the United Nations are striving to eliminate:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, the twenty-third day of October, 1946, as a day on which schools, colleges, universities, and other institutions of learning are requested to give special consideration to the problems, plans, and policies of the United Nations; and I urge the heads and governing bodies of such institutions to set aside a period on or about that day for appropriate educational exercises relating to the work of the United Nations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 17th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
