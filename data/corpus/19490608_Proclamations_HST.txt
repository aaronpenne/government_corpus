A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Patrick Henry, with surpassing eloquence, kindled in many of his countrymen that love of political freedom which burns today in the hearts of the American people; and
Whereas
 his ringing insistence, in the Virginia convention of 1788, on constitutional protection for the rights of individuals was one of the chief factors which induced the First Congress of the United States to prepare the Bill of Rights and submit it to the States for their approval; and
Whereas
 June 6, 1949, marks the sesquicentennial of the death of this gifted pioneer in our early struggle for independence; and
Whereas
 the Congress by a joint resolution approved June 8, 1949, authorizes and requests the President to issue a proclamation calling for the celebration of the week in which June 6, 1949, occurs as Patrick Henry Week, in observance of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the death of Patrick Henry:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe the week beginning Sunday, June 5, 1949, as Patrick Henry Week, with religious and civic ceremonies commemorative of the achievements of this great American in the cause of liberty. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Federal Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings during Patrick Henry Week, in order that our citizens may be reminded of this anniversary and may reflect on its significance in the annals of our freedom-loving country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES E. WEBB, 
Acting Secretary of State.
