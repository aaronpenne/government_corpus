A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 10, 1957, marks the ninth anniversary of the proclamation by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all nations and all peoples, and will be observed throughout the world as a time to increase understanding of that great document; and
Whereas
 December 15, 1957, marks the one hundred and sixty-sixth anniversary of the adoption of our Bill of Rights as the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and
Whereas
 the fundamental rights and freedoms which are our heritage as Americans—freedom of speech and of the press, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of conscience and religious worship, the right to fair trial and equal treatment under law—are recognized by peoples throughout the world as foundations of liberty and justice; and
Whereas
 the new resources which have come into being as the result of the scientific and technical advances of our time give new hope for the fulfillment of human needs and greater enjoyment of human rights:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1957, as United Nations Human Rights Day; and I call upon the citizens of the United States to honor this day by reading and studying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States, that we may be reminded of our privileges and responsibilities as a people dedicated to the principles of freedom. Let us draw strength from our own experience of liberty to use our new resources for the benefit of all mankind. Let us reaffirm our faith in the individual, and let us as members of the brotherhood of all free men strengthen and defend the blessings of liberty for this generation and for generations to come.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
