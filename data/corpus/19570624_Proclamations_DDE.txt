By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and by section 7 (c) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, on June 30, 1954, I issued Proclamation No. 3059 (3 CFR, 1954 Supp., p. 26-27) modifying item 763 of Part I of Schedule XX (original) annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, and on June 29, 1955, I further modified the said item 763 by Proclamation No. 3100 (3 CFR, 1955 Supp., p. 32-33) so as to provide that not more than 2,500,000 pounds of alsike clover seed described in the said item 763 entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during each 12-month period beginning July 1 in the years 1955 and 1956 should be dutiable at 2 cents per pound and that any such seed not subject to the rate of 2 cents per pound should be dutiable at 6 cents per pound; and
2. 
Whereas
 section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, provides that the modification of a trade-agreement concession pursuant to such section 7 shall be for such time as is necessary to prevent or remedy serious injury to the domestic industry concerned; and
3. 
Whereas
 the said further modification of the said item 763 for the period of two years ending June 30, 1957, was made with a view to a later determination of the need for continuing the said further modification beyond June 30, 1957; and
4. 
Whereas
, on March 14, 1957, I requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 10401 of October 14, 1952 (3 CFR, 1952 Supp., p. 105-106), to determine whether and to what extent the tariff quota on imports of alsike clover seed established by the said further modification will remain necessary after June 30, 1957; and
5. 
Whereas
, on May 8, 1957, the United States Tariff Commission reported to me that as a result of the investigation made pursuant to my request referred to in the fourth recital of this proclamation the Commission has found that the continuation beyond June 30, 1957, of the modification of the trade-agreement concession on alsike clover seed as set forth in Proclamation No. 3100, referred to in the first recital of this proclamation, will remain necessary in order to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry concerned; and
6. 
Whereas
 section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, authorizes the President to proclaim such modification of existing duties and such additional import restrictions as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into under the said section 350; and
7. 
Whereas
 I find that the further modification of the concession granted in the said General Agreement with respect to alsike clover seed described in the said item 763 to permit the application to such seed of the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed is necessary to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry producing the like or directly competitive product, and that upon such further modification of the said concession it will be appropriate to carry out the said General Agreement to apply to alsike clover seed the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and by section 7 (c) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, and in accordance with the provisions of the said General Agreement, do proclaimâ€”
(a) That the provision in the said item 763 with respect to alsike clover seed shall be further modified during the period July 1, 1957, to June 30, 1959, both dates inclusive, to read as follows:
(b) That during the period 'Tub, 1, 1957 to June 30, 1959, both dates inclusive, alsike clover seed described in the said item 763, as modified by paragraph (a), above, shall be subject to the duties specified in the said item 763 as so modified.
Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947, as amended and supplemented, is modified accordingly during the period July 1, 1957, to June 30, 1959, both dates inclusive.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
