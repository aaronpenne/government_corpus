A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 farm accidents each year inflict a heavy loss upon the economy of the Nation and cause untold suffering among our rural population; and
Whereas
 the death toll from farm-work accidents last year was higher than that in any other major industry; and
Whereas
 the health, prosperity, and welfare of the Nation's farm families are of vital concern to all citizens; and
Whereas
 the effect of accident-prevention programs has indicated that our rural residents, through attention to safety education, can greatly reduce accidents and the resultant loss and suffering:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 21, 1957, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge all farm families and farm workers to join in a continuing campaign designed to prevent needless accidents in their homes, on their farms, and along their highways.
I also request all persons and organizations interested in the welfare of farm people to support and participate in this special endeavor.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 14th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
Acting Secretary of State
