By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
All too often, we take for granted the freedoms that we enjoy. We must be ever mindful, however, of the sacrifices made by those men and women who have served in our Nation's armed forces in defense of those freedoms. We especially owe a debt of gratitude to those veterans who became disabled in the service of our country, for they truly know the price of freedom. Daily, these selfless men and women must endure hardship and lost opportunities because of the sacrifices they have made. We must accord them the respect and honor that they deserve. 
We must also recognize the significant contributions these special men and women have made. Both in military service and in civilian life, they have been a source of inspiration and admiration, overcoming adversity with pride and dignity. 
It is most fitting, therefore, that the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 283, has designated the week beginning November 6, 1983, as "National Disabled Veterans Week." 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 6, 1983, as National Disabled Veterans Week. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
