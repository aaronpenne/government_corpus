PAYMENT OF EDUCATIONAL BENEFITS TO VETERANS AND DEPENDENTS WHEN SCHOOLS ARE TEMPORARILY CLOSED TO CONSERVE ENERGY 
By virtue of the authority vested in me by clause (A) of Section 1780(a) of Title 38 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States of America, in order to establish a national policy in regard to payment of educational benefits to veterans and their dependents during periods in which schools are closed to conserve energy, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
SECTION 1. Whenever an educational institution submits evidence which satisfies the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs that energy consumption will be abnormally high during the winter months or that available energy supplies will be inadequate to meet the needs of the school, and that, in the interest of energy conservation, the institution plans to close between semesters or terms for a period not to exceed 45 days, the Administrator may continue to pay monthly educational assistance benefits to veterans and eligible persons enrolled in such schools. Such authority may be exercised only once during any 12-month period with respect to any educational institution. 
SEC. 2. The Administrator shall advise veterans and other eligible persons of the effect of accepting educational assistance benefits under the provisions of Section 1 of this Order on their period of entitlement.
