The 200th anniversary of the birth of the United States of America should be an occasion for a nationwide commemoration which includes all of our institutions.
One means of increasing awareness of and interest in the Bicentennial can be the widespread display of the official American Revolution Bicentennial symbol adopted by the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission, notification of which was published in the Federal Register on March 27, 1971, Volume 36, No. 60.
Since publications, correspondence, and documents of the Federal departments and agencies reach most institutions and citizens of the United States, the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission has recommended that the publications, correspondence, and documents of the Federal departments and agencies bear the official Bicentennial symbol to the extent practicable.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Each Federal department and agency of the executive branch shall use the official symbol of the American Revolution Bicentennial, adopted by the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission pursuant to the Act of December 7, 1970 (Public Law 91-528; 84 Stat. 1389), on publications, envelopes, stationery and other appropriate documents to the extent such use is permitted by law and is deemed appropriate.
SEC. 2. The official symbol may be used either in one color or in the three colors prescribed in the Graphics Manual of the American Revolution Bicentennial Commission.
SEC. 3. Use of the symbol pursuant to this order shall continue through December 31,1976.
