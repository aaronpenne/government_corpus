WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between certain corporations or organizations in the United States producing or fabricating steel or the components thereof and certain of their employees represented by the United Steel Workers of America, AFL-CIO; and
WHEREAS such dispute has resulted in a strike which, in my opinion, affects a substantial part of the steel industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, and transportation among the several States and with foreign nations, and in the production of goods for commerce, and which strike will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155 (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of George W. Taylor of Pennsylvania, Chairman, John Perkins of Delaware and Paul N. Lehoczky of Ohio as members to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of such Act on or before October 16, 1959.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
