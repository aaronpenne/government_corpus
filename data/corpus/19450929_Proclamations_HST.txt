A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the need of emergency facilities for the production of supplies and the furnishing of services required for the national defense has in recent months been substantially reduced:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 124 of the Internal Revenue Code, do hereby proclaim that the utilization of a substantial portion of the emergency facilities with respect to which certifications under subsection (f) of that section have been made is no longer required in the interest of national defense, and that the emergency period defined in section 124(e)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code (as amended) ends on the date hereof.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done at the City of Washington this 29th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
