In accordance with provision of the act of Congress approved June 4, 1897 (30 Stat. 34, 36), and by virtue of authority thereby given, and on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, it is hereby ordered that township twenty-two (22) south, range nine (9) east, and township twenty-three (23) south, range nine (9) east, Willamette meridian, Oregon, within the limits of the Cascade Range Forest Reservation be restored to the public Domain after sixty days' notice hereof by publication as required by law, these tracts having been found better adapted to agriculture than forest purposes.
