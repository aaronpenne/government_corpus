By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain articles which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
, in accordance with section 102 (3) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963, proclaimed the additional import restrictions set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
, the import restrictions on certain dairy products set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 3548 have been amended by Proclamation No. 3558 of October 5, 1963; Proclamation No. 3562 of November 26, 1963; Proclamation No. 3597 of July 7, 1964; section 88 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 950) ; Proclamation No. 3709 of March 31, 1966; Proclamation No. 3790 of June 30, 1967; Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967; Proclamation No. 3856 of June 10, 1968; Proclamation No. 3870 of September 24, 1968; and Proclamation No. 3884 of January 6, 1969; and
Whereas
, pursuant to said section 22, the Secretary of Agriculture advised me there was reason to believe that the articles, for which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed, are being imported, and are practically certain to be imported, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas
, under the authority of said section 22, I requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of said section 22 with respect to this matter and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith ; and
Whereas
, on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that the articles, for which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed, are being imported and are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that for the purpose of the first proviso of section 22 (b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the representative period for imports of such articles is the calendar years 1967 through 1969; and
Whereas
, on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that the imposition of the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed is necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such articles will not render or tend to render ineffective or materially interefere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the allocation of shares of the import quotas proclaimed herein among the countries of origin shall be based upon the proportion of such articles supplied by such countries during the twelve months July 1969 through June 1970, taking due account of any special factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the articles concerned; and
Whereas
 it has been determined advisable, in order to carry out the intent of the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 with respect to articles for which licenses are required, that the Secretary of Agriculture be authorized to adjust, within the aggregate quantity of any such article permitted to be entered from all countries during a calendar year, the quantities of any such article which may be entered from particular countries of origin ;
Whereas
 the Secretary of Commerce has advised me that, due to a processing error, the published figures for the importation during the calendar year 1967 of articles originating in Iceland, on which the import restriction of such articles set forth in item 950.10D of Part III of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States was based, understated actual imports from that country for 1967 by 89,000 pounds; and
Whereas
, in order to carry out the Presidential intention that such import restriction should be based on the level of imports of such articles from Iceland during the calendar year 1967, the figure in the quota quantity column opposite Iceland in item 950.10D of Part III of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States should be corrected by increasing the amount by 89,000 pounds;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that:
