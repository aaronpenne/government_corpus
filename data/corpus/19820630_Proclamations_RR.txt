By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Time has not altered the basic duties and responsibilities of the majority of our Armed Forces personnel since the very foundation of our country was laid in 1776. For more than two hundred years, the American men and women who have so proudly served—and are currently serving—as Noncommissioned Officers and Petty Officers have been regarded as the backbone of the Armed Forces of the United States. 
We all should recognize the great sacrifices and significant contributions made to the Nation by our fellow citizens whose traditional role of service to the Nation as soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coast guardsmen is older than the Nation itself. Their spirit and devotion to duty is evident in the long list of recipients of the Medal of Honor and other decorations of personal valor. They are the heart of our Armed Forces which sustain our freedom and way of life. The duties they perform in accomplishing their mission are a necessary and permanent part of this country's defense mechanism. Upon their shoulders lies the defense of our Nation. 
By House Joint Resolution 518, the Congress has designated the week commencing with the fourth Monday in June 1982, as "National NCO/Petty Officer Week." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week commencing with the fourth Monday in June 1982 as "National NCO/Petty Officer Week." I call on all Americans, State and local officials and private organizations to join in honoring Noncommissioned Officers and Petty Officers who serve and have served our Nation's defense objectives and to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 30th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
