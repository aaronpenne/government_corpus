By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America, I hereby determine that States, counties and local units of general purpose government have been significantly affected by major population changes within the meaning of Section 118 of Public Law 96-369 if there reside within such jurisdictions at least fifty legal immigrants from Cuba or Haiti who arrived between April 1, 1980, and September 30, 1980.

The Bureau of the Census and the Department of Commerce shall designate the estimates so supplied as official statistics. 
1-102. Beginning with fiscal year 1981, all departments and agencies of the Executive Branch shall utilize the estimates furnished under Sec. 1-101 for all formulas affecting the allocation of funds in the administration of laws distributing benefits according to population or other population characteristics, unless such utilization would be contrary to law. 
1-103. The Bureau of the Census shall supply the estimates required by Sec. 1101 for States within 30 days of the issuance of this Order and shall supply all other estimates as soon as is practicable. 
1-104. To the extent permitted by law, all departments and agencies of the Executive Branch shall cooperate with the Bureau of the Census in discharging the functions under this Order.
