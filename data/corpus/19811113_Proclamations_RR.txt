By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Presidential Proclamation 4608 of November 15, 1978, issued pursuant to section 203(a)(1), of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Act) (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(1)), provided for a temporary increase in the duty on imports of ferrochromium containing over 3 percent by weight of carbon provided for in item 607.31 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), when valued at less than 38 cents per pound of chromium content. This temporary increase was for the period from November 17, 1978, through November 16, 1981. 
2. The United States International Trade Commission (the Commission), pursuant to sections 203(i)(2) and 203(i)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(i)(2) and 2253(i)(3)) and following an investigation, advised the President (United States International Trade Commission, Report TA-203-8) that termination of the temporary increase in the duty on certain high-carbon ferrochromium would have a significant adverse economic effect on the domestic high-carbon ferrochromium industry and recommended that the increased duty be extended. 
3. Pursuant to section 203(h)(3) of the Act and (19 U.S.C. 2253(h)(3)), after taking into account the advice of the Commission and the considerations required by section 202(c) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I have determined that extension for one year of the increased duty is in the national interest. 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 203(h)(3) of the Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), do proclaim that- 
(1) Part 1 of Schedule XX to the GATT shall remain modified to conform to the extension of the duty increase provided by the proclamation. 
(2.) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS shall remain modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(3) This proclamation shall be effective as to those articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after November 16, 1981, and before the close of November 15, 1982, unless the period of effectiveness is modified or terminated earlier. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
