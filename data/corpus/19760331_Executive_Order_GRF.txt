Walter C. Sauer, First Vice President and Vice Chairman, Export-Import Bank of the United States, became subject to mandatory retirement for age as of March 31, 1975, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted by Executive order. Mr. Sauer was exempted from mandatory retirement until March 31, 1976, by Executive Order No. 11847 of March 28, 1975. 
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Walter C. Sauer continue to be exempted from such mandatory retirement. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Subsection (c) of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Walter C. Sauer from mandatory retirement until March 31, 1977.
