A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the armed forces of the United States, having dedicated themselves unselfishly to the service of their country, are now fighting and dying on foreign soil in defense of the principles of freedom which this Nation has cherished since its birth; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that we dedicate one day each year to paying tribute to the armed forces and to rendering homage to them as the defenders of our people, our nation, and our democratic way of life:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 19, 1951, as Armed Forces Day; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to provide for the celebration of that day in such manner as to honor the members of our armed forces.
As Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to mark the designated day with appropriate ceremonies, and to cooperate with civil authorities in suitable observances of the day.
I also request my fellow citizens to display the flag of the United States on Armed Forces Day, and by fitting exercises to demonstrate their recognition of the gallantry, sacrifice, and devotion to duty of the men and women of the armed forces.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this second day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
