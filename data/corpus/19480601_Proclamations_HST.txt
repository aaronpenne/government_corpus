A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted the Stars and Stripes as our national emblem; and
Whereas
 Americans of varied heritage, creed, and race have found refuge from oppression and surcease of fear under the protecting folds of Old Glory; and
Whereas
 in our day the American flag symbolizes the realizes of the ideal of freedom in a world where that ideal is insecure; and
Whereas
 it has properly become a national custom to observe the anniversary of the adoption of the flag by public and private ceremonies in commemoration of the flag's inspiring history and in recognition of its present meaning:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on June 14, 1948, and I call upon the people of the Nation to observe that day as Flag Day by suitable ceremonies and by the display of the flag at their homes and other appropriate places. I also urge all citizens to reflect upon the responsibilities which this banner enjoins as well as the privileges it carries, remembering that the flag represents the nation and that our nation and its citizens should uphold the concept of free government on all occasions in order that the blessings of liberty may flourish among men.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 1st day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
