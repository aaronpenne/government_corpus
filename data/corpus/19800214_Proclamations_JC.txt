By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United States has set out with vigor and determination to implement the historic trade agreements concluded in the Tokyo Round of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations. The Administration has conducted a major reorganization of the Federal Government's trade functions in order to take greater advantage of the opportunities these agreements offer. The 1980's begin to emerge as a time both of challenge and renaissance in the world of international commerce. They will be America's decade for trade. 
Expanded world trade contributes to the growth of economies throughout the world and opens new avenues of cooperation that serve us in our quest for peace and human rights. 
Increased U.S. exports will mean more jobs for American workers, new markets for American business, more secure income for American farmers, a strengthened American dollar and lower costs for American consumers. Trade promotes our economic health and moves us closer to our goal of a prosperous and secure America at peace with the world. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 18, 1980, as World Trade Week, and I request all Americans to cooperate in observing that week by participating with the business community and all levels of Government in activities that emphasize the importance of world trade to the United States economy and to our relations with other nations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
