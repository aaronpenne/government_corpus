A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 recreational boating is playing an increasingly important part in the lives of millions of Americans who look to it as a means of maintaining physical vigor and mental alertness; and 
Whereas
 the resulting increased use of our waterways has caused a corresponding increase in safety problems; and 
Whereas
 this healthful outdoor activity can be enhanced and loss of life and property reduced by adherence to safe boating principles; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, in recognition of the importance of such safe boating practices, by a joint resolution, approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week that includes the Fourth of July as National Safe Boating Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, do hereby designate the week beginning June 30, 1963, as National Safe Boating Week. 
In pursuance of the objectives of this Proclamation, I urge all persons, organizations and Governmental agencies interested in recreational boating and safety afloat to publicize and observe National Safe Boating Week: 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join in this observance. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
