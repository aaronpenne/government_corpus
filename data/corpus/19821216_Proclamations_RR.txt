By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United Nations' General Assembly has proclaimed 1983 World Communications Year: Development of Communications Infrastructures. Its purpose is to stimulate accelerated worldwide development of communications infrastructures and to provide an opportunity for all countries to undertake an in-depth review and analysis of their policies on communications development. 
Communications systems have taken on an increasingly vital role in every facet of economic, political, and social progress. While there have been remarkable advances in both this technology and its applications-ranging from health care, education, and banking transactions to weather observations and earth resource location-many nations have not been able to benefit appreciably from these capabilities. 
Through partnership of United States private businesses, in cooperation with the International Telecommunication Union, we have an opportunity to promote the well-being of people around the globe. I encourage the United States communications industry-with its position of world leadership in this technologyâ€”to actively and voluntarily support this effort to stimulate the development of communications infrastructures in all nations. 
Now, Therefore, in keeping with the goals of the World Communications Year, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim 1983 as World Communications Year: Development of Communications Infrastructures, in the United States. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of Dec., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
