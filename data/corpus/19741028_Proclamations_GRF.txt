By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The greatness of a nation of free institutions is measured by the degree of enlightenment of its citizens. 
By that measure, ours is a great Nation. Our States provide schools for all Americans. And those schools-public, private and church-affiliated-are the vital centers of neighborhood and community life throughout the Nation. 
It is most appropriate that the theme of this year's American Education Week is "Stay Involved," for there is no end to the educational process. "Staying involved" means that each of us is sufficiently concerned about the training and development of our young people to make the contribution to that educational process that our special training, experience, and perspective allow us to make. 
I know that all Americans will resolve to stay involved in the educational process, for the knowledge we impart to our children today will determine the future of our people. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of October 27 through November 2, 1974, as American Education Week. 
I invite all Americans to join with me and the dedicated educators of our Nation in exploring the more vital role schools can play in neighborhood and community life. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
