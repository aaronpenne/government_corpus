By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
It is now nearly two hundred years since America's Independence was sought and won. Then, as today, the achievement of our Nation's goals was met through the devoted efforts of Americans who gave loyal service. 
The United States has become the greatest Nation in history because of the loyalty of our people to our Constitution, to our laws, and to those ideals which they represent. 
The thousands who become citizens each year through naturalization take an oath to support the United States. One can sense the meaning and the spirit of loyalty in those proceedings. For most of us who were born to the freedoms we enjoy, a declaration of loyalty has not been such a conspicuous event in our lives. It is, nonetheless, reflected in our patriotic efforts. 
In recognition of the need for "a special day for the reaffirmation of loyalty to the United States of America and for the recognition of the heritage of American freedom", the Congress, by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369, 36 U.S.C. 162), designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States and upon patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe Thursday, May 1, 1975, as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies. 
I call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day in testimony of our loyalty to this Nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
