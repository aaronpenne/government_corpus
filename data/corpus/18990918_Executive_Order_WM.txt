In the exercise of the power conferred upon me by the Joint Resolution of Congress, approved by the President on July 7th, 1898, entitled "Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States," the President of the United States hereby directs that the issue of Registers to vessels by the Authorities of Hawaii entitling such vessels to all the rights and privileges of Hawaiian vessels in the ports of Nations or upon the High Seas, shall hereafter cease.
In witness whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY
