By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The millions of hunting and fishing licenses issued each year reflect a widespread appreciation of the healthy recreation, peaceful solitude and closeness to nature these pursuits offer. 
America's hunters and fishermen have long been leaders in the conservation movement. They understand the importance of clean air, good water and adequate habitat for wildlife. They support those goals through the purchase of licenses and the payment of taxes on hunting and fishing equipment. They and the organizations that represent them are also effective leaders in the promotion of firearm and boating safety. 
It is appropriate that we recognize all of these contributions by the observance of a National Hunting and Fishing Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, September 22, 1979, and the fourth Saturday of September in each succeeding year, as National Hunting and Fishing Day. 
I urge all of our citizens to .join with outdoor sportsmen in the wise use and management of our natural resources. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
