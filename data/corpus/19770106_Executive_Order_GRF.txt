By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 801(c) of the Department of Defense Appropriation Authorization Act, 1977 (90 Stat. 929; 10 U.S.C. 1401a note), section 292 of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees (90 Stat. 2472; 50 U.S.C. 403 note), and as President of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
SECTION 1. The Director of Central Intelligence shall:
(a) on January 1 of each year, or within a reasonable time thereafter, determine the percent change in the price index published for December of the preceding year over the price index published for June of the preceding year, and
(b) on July 1 of each year, or within a reasonable time thereafter, determine the percent change in the price index published for June of such year over the price index published for December of the preceding year. 
SEC. 2. If in any year the percent change determined under either section 1(a) or 1(b) indicates a rise in the price index, then:
(a) effective March 1 of such year, in the case of an increase under section 1(a), each annuity payable from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund having a commencing date not later than such March 1 shall be increased by the percent change computed under such paragraph, adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent, or
(b) effective September 1 of such year, in the case of an increase under section 1(b), each annuity payable from the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement and Disability Fund having a commencing date not later than such September 1 shall be increased by the percent change computed under such paragraph, adjusted to the nearest 1/10 of 1 percent. 
SEC. 3. The changes made by sections 1 and 2 of this order shall apply to any increase in annuities after October 1, 1976, except that with respect to the first date after October 1, 1976 on which the Director is to determine a percent change, such percent change shall be determined by computing the change in the price index published for the month immediately preceding such first date over the price index for the last month immediately prior to October 1, 1976 for which the price index showed a percent rise forming the basis of a cost of living annuity increase under section 291(a) of the Central Intelligence Agency Retirement Act of 1964 for Certain Employees, as in effect immediately prior to October 1, 1976.
