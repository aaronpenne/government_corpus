By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Millions of Americans have come to view jogging as an enjoyable, affordable, and effective way to keep in shape. 
Most medical authorities agree with them, saying that a reasonable and regular program of jogging improves the heart, the circulatory system, and the lungs, while helping runners take off, or ward off, excess weight. 
Everyone who has run knows that its most important value is in removing tension and allowing a release from whatever other cares the day may bring. It is a blessing to our Nation that so many of our people have rediscovered this simple pleasure. 
By Joint Resolution (H.J. Res. 685) the Congress has designated October 14, 1978, as National Jogging Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby declare October 14, 1978, as National Jogging Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
