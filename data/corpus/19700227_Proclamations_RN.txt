2. 
Whereas
 among the proclaimed modifications were modifications in the rates of duty on glass of the kinds which are now provided for in items 542.11-.98 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter referred to as "sheet glass");
3. 
Whereas,

Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its Investigation No. TEA-I15 under section 301(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1901(b)), on the basis of which investigation and a hearing duly held in connection therewith the members of said Commission divided, with respect to sheet glass, into two groups composed of an equal number of Commissioners, one group being unanimously agreed that sheet glass is, as a result in major part of concessions granted under trade agreements, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to cause serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles; and the other group being unanimously agreed that sheet glass is not, as a result in major part of concessions granted under trade agreements, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive articles;
8. 
Whereas
 under the authority of section 330(d) (1) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1330(d) (1)), I consider the affirmative finding of the first group of Commissioners as the finding of the Tariff Commission with respect to injury; and
9. 
Whereas
 I have determined that the rates of duty hereinafter proclaimed are, when coupled with adjustment assistance hereinafter provided, necessary to remedy serious injury to the sheet glass industry:
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including sections 201(a) (2), 302(a) (2) and (3), and 351(a) (1) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821 (a) (2), 19 U.S.C. 1902(a) (2) and (3), and 1981(a) (1)), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, do proclaim that

In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
