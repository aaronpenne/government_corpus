A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 trade among the free nations of the world raises the standards of living of the peoples of such nations and fosters friendly relations among them; and
Whereas
 international trade makes it possible for us and our allies to obtain supplies and materials necessary for the mobilization of a common defense against aggression; and
Whereas
 it is particularly fitting in this time of international tension that the ideals and effectiveness of free enterprise should be reasserted:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 20, 1951, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the several States, Territories, possessions, and municipalities of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week. 
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups,, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
