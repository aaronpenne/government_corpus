A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Black Mesa Forest Reserve, in the Territory of Arizona, was established by proclamation dated August seventeenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight;
And Whereas,
 it is provided by the Act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An Act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes," that "The President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve";
And Whereas,
 it appears that the public good would be promoted by adding to the said forest reserve certain lands, within the Territory of Arizona, which are in part covered with timber;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by the aforesaid act of Congress, do proclaim that the aforesaid Black Mesa Forest Reserve is hereby enlarged to include the said additional lands, and that the boundaries of the reserve are now as shown on the diagram forming a part hereof;
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired: Provided, that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler, or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing, or settlement was made,
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 30th day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and six, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirtieth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
