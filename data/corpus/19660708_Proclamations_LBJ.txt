A Proclamation
Whereas,
 the Joint Resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), authorizes and requests the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation each year designating the third week in July as "Captive Nations Week" until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world; and 
Whereas,
 freedom and justice are the inalienable rights of all peoples; and 
Whereas,
 these basic rights are presently denied to many peoples throughout the world; and 
Whereas,
 the United States of America, from its founding as a Nation, has firmly subscribed to the principles of national independence and human liberty; and 
Whereas,
 in keeping with this tradition, it remains an essential purpose and a fundamental policy of the United States of America to sustain these principles and to encourage their realization by all peoples: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 17, 1966, as Captive Nations Week. 
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to give renewed devotion to the just aspirations of all people for national independence and human liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 8th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Secretary of State
