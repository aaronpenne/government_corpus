WHEREAS disputes exist between the Akron & Barberton Belt Railroad Company and certain other carriers designated in list A attached hereto and made a part hereof, carriers under Federal management, and certain workers represented by the seventeen cooperating (non-operating) railway labor organizations designated in list B attached hereto and made a part hereof; and
WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 10155 of August 25, 1950, possession, control, and operation of the transportation systems owned or operated by the said carriers, together with the transportation systems owned or operated by certain other carriers, were assumed by the President, through the Secretary of the Army; and
WHEREAS these disputes threaten, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive the country of essential transportation service, and also threaten to interfere with the operation by the Secretary of the Army of transportation systems taken pursuant to the said Executive Order No. 10155:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States including section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), and subject to the provisions of that section, I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate the said disputes. Nothing in this order shall be construed to derogate from the authority of the Secretary of the Army under the said Executive Order No. 10155.
No Member of the said Board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railway employees or any carrier.
The Board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the said disputes within thirty days from the date of this order. The Board may, to the extent it deems necessary or desirable, make separate and independent findings with respect to each of the carriers involved.
In performing its functions under this order the Board shall comply with the requirements of section 502 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended.
