A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Proclamation No. 2708 of October 25, 1946, authorizes the Secretary of the Treasury to permit, under such regulations and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary, the importation free of duty of any articles which the Housing Expediter designates and certifies as timber, lumber, or lumber products suitable for the construction or completion of housing accommodations; and
Whereas
 it now appears that it would be in the public interest to terminate the aforesaid proclamation on August 15, 1947:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and in particular by section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 696), do hereby declare that Proclamation No. 2708 is hereby amended to provide that it shall terminate on August 15, 1947.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
G. C. MARSHALL,
Secretary of State.
