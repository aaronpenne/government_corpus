By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
From the time of the first settlers, the forests of America have been valued for their beauty and their usefulness. The beauty and majesty of the great American forests have given us incomparable benefits; the utility of the forests has given us shelter, furnishings, chemicals, papers, and a host of other products essential to our well-being and comfort.
American forests grow on one-third of our entire country and provide us with over ten billion cubic feet of raw material every year. Equally important, they have yielded even more benefits in the form of water conservation, forage, and recreation for the additional betterment of life for all Americans.
The Congress, in order to re-emphasize the importance and heritage of our forest resources, has by a joint resolution of September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898), designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 19, 1969, as National Forest Products Week, with activities and ceremonies designed to direct public attention to the forest resources with which we have been so abundantly blessed and to the riches which they provide for our material and spiritual advantage.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
