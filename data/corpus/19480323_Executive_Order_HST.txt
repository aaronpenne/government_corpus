WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between coal operators and associations signatory to the National Bituminous Coal Wage Agreement of 1947 and certain of their employees represented by the International Union, United Mine Workers of America, also signatory to the said agreement, involving wages or terms and conditions of employment; and
WHEREAS in my opinion such dispute has resulted in a strike affecting a substantial part of the bituminous coal industry, an industry engaged in trade and commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, and in the production of goods for commerce, which strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Public Law 101, 80th Congress), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before April 5, 1948.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
