A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 every American should be concerned with the development of a safe, efficient, and modern transportation network for our growing Nation; and 
Whereas
 highways have been, and will continue to be, a vital element in our transportation system and a key to our continued economic growth; and 
Whereas
 the Nation is now in the midst of an accelerated highway construction program which is a joint effort of the Federal and State governments and an unparalleled example of American enterprise and achievement; and 
Whereas
 the urgent need for this program was tragically demonstrated last year when a record 41,000 people lost their lives on our roads and streets; and 
Whereas
 the completion of the National System of Interstate and Defense Highways will save an estimated 5,000 lives each year and provide even greater efficiency and flexibility in transportation; and 
Whereas
 the support of every citizen is essential to the completion of the program on schedule and the realization of the system's full benefits: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of May 26 through June 1, 1963, as National Highway Week in recognition of the importance of highways to our economy and to our way of life; and I urge the Governors of the States and mayors of cities to issue similar proclamations. 
I also ask the appropriate officials of the Federal, State, and local governments, as well as public and private organizations and the general public, to join in observance of this significant occasion. 
During this period I encourage all Americans to consider and appreciate the value of highway transportation to their own activities and to our national welfare. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
