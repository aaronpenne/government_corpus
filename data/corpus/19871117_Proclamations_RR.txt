By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Because teachers are among the most important role models in our society, it is truly fitting that we set aside African American Education Week to encourage young African Americans to pursue careers in the field of education. Americans have always deeply valued the rewards and the advancement that education makes possible. No task is more vital to the strength and security of our Nation than that of providing good education for all our citizens. So that America continues to remain a land of opportunity for all people, we should encourage a wide representation of African Americans as teachers and continued concern for African American students. The National Alliance of Black School Educators is committed to these goals. By inspiring students with a vision of excellence, we can touch the lives of countless youngsters in present and future generations for the better. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 174, has designated the week beginning November 15, 1987, as "African American Education Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 15, 1987, as African American Education Week. I call upon officials of government at every level, educators, private sector groups, and all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities in support of the achievement of academic excellence among African Americans. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
