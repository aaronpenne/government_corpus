A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 many of the young people of our country, under the auspices of a nation-wide organization, are learning actual business methods by setting up and operating their own small-scale enterprises; and
Whereas
 the sponsors of these energetic juniors—businessmen of many local communities—are voluntarily giving of their time, their counsel, and their experience for the benefit of these junior achievers; and
Whereas
 the experience gained by these young people in conducting their own enterprises will heighten their understanding of the privileges and duties of citizenship and better prepare them for future leadership in industry and in their communities; and
Whereas
 initiative, a sense of individual dignity, and the determination to mold one's own future are basic elements of the character of the people of our nation; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Concurrent Resolution 73, agreed to January 17, 1957, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning January 27, 1957, as National Junior Achievement Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of January 27 through February 2, 1957, as National Junior Achievement Week; and I urge all our citizens to observe the week by honoring Junior Achievers and their volunteer adult advisers through appropriate ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fifth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
