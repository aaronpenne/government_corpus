By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 this nation has been conceived in prayer and devotion by men and women who were moved under God to found a nation where principles of right should form the lasting cornerstone; And whereas these principles purchased at the price of great sacrifice have been fostered by a worthy posterity; And whereas a great war has lately laid its costly demands upon our land:
Now, Therefore, I, Warren G. Harding,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, the thirtieth day of May, a day already freighted with sacred and stimulating memories, a day of public memorial. I invite my fellow citizens fittingly to pay homage on this day to a noble dead who sleep in homeland, beneath the sea or on foreign field that we who survive might enjoy the blessings of peace and happiness, and to the end that liberty and justice, without which no nation can exist, shall live forever.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 in the District of Columbia this third day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and twenty-one and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and forty-fifth.
WARREN G. HARDING
By the President:
CHARLES E. HUGHES, 
Secretary of State
