A Proclamation
 
Whereas Willis Anderson, of the County of Alexandria, in the District of Columbia, is charged with having recently murdered Gerrard Arnold, late of the said county; and
Whereas it is represented to me that the said Willis Anderson has absconded and secretes himself, so that he can not be apprehended and brought to justice for the offense of which he is so charged; and
Whereas the apprehension and trial of the said Willis Anderson is an example due to justice and humanity, and would be every way salutary in its influence:
Now, therefore, I have thought fit to issue this my proclamation, hereby exhorting the citizens of the United States, and particularly those of this District, and requiring all officers, according to their respective stations, to use their utmost endeavors to apprehend and bring the said Willis Anderson to justice for the atrocious crime with which he stands charged as aforesaid; and I do moreover offer a reward of $250 for the apprehension of the said Willis Anderson and his delivery to an officer or officers of justice in the county aforesaid, so that he may be brought to trial for the murder aforesaid and be otherwise dealt with according to law.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto signed my name and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed to these presents.
Done at Washington, this 10th day of September, A. D. 1827, and of the Independence of the United States the fifty-second.
J. Q. ADAMS.
