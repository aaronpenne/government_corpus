A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 many millions of our fellow countrymen are engaged in recreational boating; and 
Whereas
 increasing public participation in this healthy, outdoor sport has emphasized the need for greater attention to courtesy and safety to minimize boating incidents of the type which often lead to boating mishaps; and 
Whereas
 concerted community action is required to attain the goal of making boating one of the safest family sports; and 
Whereas
, in recognition of the value of maintaining high safety standards on our waterways, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week that includes the Fourth of July as National Safe Boating Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, do hereby designate the week beginning July 1, 1962, as National Safe Boating Week. 
In pursuance of the objectives of this Proclamation, I urge all persons, organizations, and Governmental agencies interested in recreational boating and safety afloat to publicize and observe National Safe Boating Week. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join in this observance. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
