A Proclamation
 
Veterans Day affords all Americans a special opportunity to honor the deeds of those who sacrificed so much to answer the call to arms during the life of this great country. On this day, our Nation is united in tribute to the valiant men and women who have unselfishly given of themselves to serve in our Armed Forces. 
Words alone are insufficient to express our lasting gratitude and admiration to those whose patriotism and courage have ensured our peace and freedom despite threats of tyranny and aggression. Significant disruptions in their lives and other personal hardships have been the price that our Nation's veterans have paid so that the rest of us might enjoy the fruits of justice and liberty. 
In order that we pay meaningful tribute to their efforts, Congress has provided (5 U.S.C. 6103(a)) that November 11 shall be set aside each year as a national holiday to honor America's veterans. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call on all Americans to join in observing Thursday, November 11, 1982, as Veterans Day. I urge both public ceremonies, as well as private thoughts and prayers, in recognition of the great contribution of our veterans to an America that today is an example to all nations of freedom, liberty, and democracy. On this day, let us give special consideration to those who have died in our Nation's wars and to those who have been disabled. 
I call upon Federal, State and local Government officials to mark Veterans Day by displaying the flag of the United States, and I ask those Government officials to support fully and personally its observance by appropriate ceremonies throughout the country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
