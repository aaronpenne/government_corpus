By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Between 1941 and 1971, a number of pregnant women in the United States were prescribed DES (diethylstilbestrol) to prevent miscarriage. This powerful synthetic hormone was used not only in problem pregnancies but also in some normal pregnancies. As a result, some three million children were exposed to DES while in the womb. 
Many scientists fear that exposure to DES may be linked to some forms of cancer. This fear is enough to call attention to the possible health threats faced by past users of DES and their children. Many of the cancers that may be related to DES can be effectively treated if detected at an early, localized stage. Awareness of the threats posed by past DES use should result in increased attention to regular checkups, the first step to effective detection and treatment. 
To increase the public understanding of DES exposure, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 63, has designated the week of April 21 through April 27, 1985, as "National DES Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of April 21 through April 27, 1985, as National DES Awareness Week. I call upon all government agencies and the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 25th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
