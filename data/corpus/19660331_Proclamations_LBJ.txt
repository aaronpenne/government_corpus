By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
Whereas,
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), by Presidential Proclamations limitations have been imposed on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into United States in any quota year; and 
Whereas,
 in accordance with section 102 (3) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963 (28 F.R. 9279) proclaimed the additional import restrictions set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and 
Whereas,
 the import restrictions on certain dairy products set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 3548 have been amended by Proclamation No. 3558 of October 5, 1963, Proclamation No. 3562 of November 26, 1963, Proclamation No. 3597 of July 7, 1964, and section 88 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 950) ; and 
Whereas,
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believes that additional quantities of cheddar cheese may be imported for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to milk and butterfat or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and 
Whereas,
 under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and 
Whereas,
 the Secretary of Agriculture has determined and reported to me that a condition exists with respect to cheddar cheese which requires emergency treatment and the quantitative limitation imposed on cheddar cheese should be increased for the quota year ending June 30, 1966, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action; and 
Whereas,
 I find and declare that the importation during the remainder of the quota year ending June 30, 1966, of the additional quantity of cheddar cheese permitted by the increase in quota specified below will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to milk and butterfat and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and that a condition exists which requires emergency treatment and the quantitative limitation imposed on cheddar cheese should be increased for the quota year ending June 30, 1966, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim thatâ€” 
The quota quantity amount for cheddar cheese, and cheese and substitutes for cheese containing, or processed from, cheddar cheese specified in item 950.08 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is increased from 2,780,100 pounds to 3,706,800 pounds for the quota year ending June 30, 1966, such increase to continue in effect pending Presidential action upon receipt of the report and recommendations of the Tariff Commission with respect thereto. The quota quantity amount for such products for any quota year after the quota year ending June 30, 1966, shall be 2,780,100 pounds unless changed by further Presidential action. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 31st day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
