By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In order to recognize and emphasize the importance of forest resources and forest products to the nation, the Congress has by the joint resolution of September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898) designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 18, 1970, as National Forest Products Week, with activities and ceremonies designed to direct public attention toward, and demonstrate our gratitude for, the forest resources with which we have been so abundantly blessed and for their contributions to our material, emotional and spiritual advantages.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
