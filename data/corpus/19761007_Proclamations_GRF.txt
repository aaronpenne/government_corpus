By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Throughout America, especially in small towns, communities, and in rural areas, approximately one million volunteer firefighters outnumber fulltime paid firefighters by about four to one. 
From the beginning of our Nation's history, they have risked, and often sacrificed, their lives fighting fires in their communities with no expectation of financial reward. This unselfish concern for life and property is a manifestation of the best in the American character. 
In recognition of the enormous contributions made by these volunteers, the House (September 21, 1976) and the Senate (October 1, 1976) have requested that the President proclaim the week of October 3, 1976, as National Volunteer Firemen Week (H.J. Res. 1008). 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 3, 1976, and ending October 9, 1976, as National Volunteer Firemen Week. 
As requested by the Congress, I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first. 
GERALD R. FORD
