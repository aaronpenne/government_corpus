A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is in the American tradition to help others to help themselves; and
Whereas
, by hiring the physically handicapped, we reaffirm our faith in the fundamental values of our free enterprise system and demonstrate the effective use of our manpower; and
Whereas
 equal opportunity for employment is basic to our belief in human dignity and should never be denied to any person because of physical impairment; and

I also urge the Governors of States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry, educational and religious groups, labor, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, scientific, professional, and fraternal organizations, and all other interested organizations and individuals, including the handicapped themselves, to participate actively in this observance.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
