By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 5941 of Title 5 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, in order to authorize the gradual reduction of allowances and differentials payable in nonforeign areas if the reduction is based on program or methodology revisions, Executive Order No. 10000 of September 16, 1948, as amended, is further amended by revising Section 210 to read as follows:
"SEC. 210. Periodic review. The Civil Service Commission shall periodically, but at least annually, review the places designated, the rates fixed, and the regulations prescribed pursuant to this Part, with a view to making such changes therein as will insure that payment of additional compensation under the provisions of this Part shall continue only during the continuance of conditions justifying such payment and shall not in any instance exceed the amount justified: Provided, That if program or methodology revisions would substantially reduce an established differential or allowance rate, then the rate of such additional compensation may be reduced gradually.".
