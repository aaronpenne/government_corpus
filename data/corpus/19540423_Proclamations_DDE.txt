A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress of the United States has designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution of the United States and in recognition of all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, enjoy the privileges and assume the responsibilities of citizenship; and
Whereas
 our Constitution, which guarantees priceless freedoms to us as citizens of the United States and to our posterity and sets forth a concept of liberty that has been an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere, takes on still deeper meaning in these days of critical international affairs; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid resolution authorizes the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Friday, September 17, 1954, and urge the people of the Nation to display the flag on that day at their homes and other suitable places.
I also urge Federal, State, and local officials, and patriotic, religious, educational, civic, and other interested organizations, to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on Citizenship Day in which all our citizens may join for rededication to the great principles for which this Nation stands.
And I call upon all our people to give special thought and consideration on that day both to their rights and to their responsibilities as citizens of the United States, to the end that our citizenship may have deeper meaning and greater strength.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 23d day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
