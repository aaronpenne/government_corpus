The Marshals of the United States in the vicinity of forts where political prisoners are held will supply decent lodging and subsistence for such prisoners, unless they shall prefer to provide in those respects for themselves, in which cases they will be allowed to do so by the commanding officers in charge.
Approved, and the Secretary of State will transmit the order to marshals, the Lieutenant-General, and Secretary of the Interior.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
