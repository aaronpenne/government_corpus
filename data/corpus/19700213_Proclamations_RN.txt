By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In 1698 a book was published in London to inform and encourage political migrants to the colony founded by William Penn. The book told of the abundance of natural resources that could be found in this part of America, and, in part, told of ". . . the Mines where is Copper and Iron, besides other Metals and Minerals. . . ."
This early reference to the mineral resources of America reminds us that mineral industries have long provided the basic raw materials that have contributed so vitally to our nation's growth.
In recognition of the contributions that the mineral industry has made to the well-being of the nation, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 888, has designated the period of February 13 through February 19, 1970, as Mineral Industry Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, invite the governments of States and communities and all citizens to join during Mineral Industry Week in recognition of the contributions of the American mineral industry to the security, health, and well-being of our nation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
