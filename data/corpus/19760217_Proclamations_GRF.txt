By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The Mark Twain National Forest and the Clark National Forest were established within the State of Missouri. Part of the Clark National Forest was later transferred to the Mark Twain National Forest; at the same time, part of the Mark Twain National Forest was transferred to the Clark National Forest. Subsequently, both national forests have been successfully administered as if they were a single national forest. This experience indicates that it is now in the public interest to consolidate these two national forests. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 24 of the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1103, as amended (16 U.S.C. 471), the Act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (16 U.S.C. 473), and by Section 11 of the Act of March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 963 (16 U.S.C. 521), do hereby proclaim that the Clark National Forest in the State of Missouri (Proclamation No. 2363 of September 11, 1939, as amended), and the Mark Twain National Forest in the State of Missouri (Proclamation No. 2362 of September 11, 1939, as amended), are hereby designated and hereafter shall be known as the mark Twain National Forest. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the IndeÂ­pendence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
