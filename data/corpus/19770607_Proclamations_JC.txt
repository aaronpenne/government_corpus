A Proclamation
 
A father watches his children grow and shares their joys. He comforts them through the many minor crises that are of enormous significance to a child. But the challenges of raising a child in an increasingly complex and uncertain world require more than just a desire to be a good parent. A father must be ready to supply the love, discipline, security and support from which his children can draw strength--even as he faces his own problems and concerns which are, for a time, beyond their understanding. 
In recognition of the contributions of our Nation's fathers, the Congress, by joint resolution of April 24, 1972 (86 Stat. 124, 36 U.S.C. 142a), has designated the third Sunday in June of each year as Father's Day and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, June 19, 1977, be observed as Father's Day. 
I am instructing federal officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places. 
I ask all Americans to make a special effort this year to let our Nation's fathers know that they will always have our love and gratitude. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
