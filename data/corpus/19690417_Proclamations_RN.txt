By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
A half century ago—more than a year before the 19th Amendment was ratified—women from states where they already had the vote met to establish a League of Women Voters. Their purpose was to promote political responsibility through informed and active participation of citizens in government.
For fifty years the League of Women Voters has provided Americans in every state with information on candidates and issues and it has furnished a non-partisan platform from which all candidates may be seen and heard. These activities have strengthened government and have helped to sustain the public weal.
Whether it be concern for our urban malaise or desire for better international cooperation, whether it be conservation of our natural resources or the revitalization of our State and local governments, the League of Women Voters deserves the cooperation and encouragement of all Americans.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, call upon all our citizens to join with the League of Women Voters of the United States in the observance of its fiftieth anniversary in 1970.
I urge all businesses, industries, foundations, and civic organizations to give the full measure of their support to the League and its activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 17th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
