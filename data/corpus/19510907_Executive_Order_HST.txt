By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat.404) and by section 1753 of the Revised Statues of the United States, Executive Order No. 10157 of August 28, 1950, entitled "Enabling Certain Employees of the Federal Government To Acquire a Competitive Status", as amended by Executive Order No. 10217 of February 26, 1951," is hereby further amended as follows:
1. Paragraph 1(a) is amended to read as follows:
"(a) The employee shall have served continuously in a full-time, active-duty status in the competitive service, without a break in service of more than sixty calendar days, during the two years immediately prior to the date of this order: Provided, that military service shall not be regarded as a break in service: Provided further, that substitute employees in the postal service who were appointed on or before August 28, 1948, and who performed service during the required two-year period in positions within the authorized quota of substitutes at the post office concerned shall be considered as having served continuously in a full-time, active-duty status for purposes of this order."
2. Paragraph 1(c) is amended to read as follows:
"(c) The acquisition of competitive status by the employee must be recommended to the Civil Service Commission by the head of the agency in which he is employed within six months of the date of this order: Provided, that in the case of an employee who has left , or before the expiration of such six-months' period leaves, his civilian position for the purpose of entering the armed forces of the United States, such recommendation must be made within six months of the date of honorable termination of the military service of the employee: Provided further, that in the cases of the substitute employees in the postal service specified in the last proviso of paragraph 1(a), above, and in cases where, due to an inadvertence on the part of an agency, recommendation was not submitted to the Civil Service Commission within the prescribed six-months' period, such recommendation may be accepted if received by the Commission not later than March 1, 1952.
