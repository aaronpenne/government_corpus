By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the United States participates in the International Coffee Organization pursuant to the International Coffee Agreement, 1962 (14 UST 1911; TIAS 5055), I hereby designate the International Coffee Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.
This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which the International Coffee Organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.
