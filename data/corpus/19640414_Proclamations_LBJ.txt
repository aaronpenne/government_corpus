A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 17, 1964, marks the one hundred and seventy-seventh anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787; and 
Whereas
 the year 1964 marks the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of the organization of our constitutional form of government for in 1789, our first Congress convened, our first President was inaugurated, and our Federal judicial system was established; and 
Whereas
 our constitutional form of government has withstood the test of time and the ravages of war, internal strife, natural catastrophes, economic disasters, and international conspiracies and still stands constantly young and vigorous and ever resolute in its quest for peace, liberty, justice, and economic opportunity for all mankind; and 
Whereas
 the manner in which the entire Nation reacted to the crisis occasioned by the assassination of President Kennedy and gave me, as its new President under the terms of our Constitution, its undivided loyalty and support in those dark days attests to the strength and stability of our Government; and 
Whereas
 in this world of many challenges-some of which endanger the rights of free men-it is imperative that all our citizens, whether native born or naturalized, be aware of the acts and events that led to the adoption of the Constitution and of the adversities that have subsequently proved its durability in order that they may have a better understanding and appreciation of the basic principles upon which this Nation was founded and by which it lives; and 
Whereas
, this year, it is more appropriate than ever that our citizens proclaim to the world our renewed determination to preserve, regardless of cost, the constitutional system of government which has sustained our Nation and its people through a century and three-quarters of turbulent history and which stands today as a beacon of hope to freedom-loving people everywhere; and 
Whereas
, by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of those citizens who have come of age and those who have been naturalized during the year; and 
Whereas
, by a joint resolution approved August 2,1956 (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week-a time for the study and observance of the acts and events which resulted in the formation of the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 those resolutions of the Congress authorize the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day and of Constitution Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1964; and I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies on that day to inspire all our citizens to pledge themselves anew to the service of their country and to the support and defense of the Constitution. 
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1964, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches and in other suitable places to the end that our citizens may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the rights and responsibilities of United States Citizenship. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at, the City of Washington this fourteenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
By the President: 
George W. Ball,
Acting Secretary of State.
