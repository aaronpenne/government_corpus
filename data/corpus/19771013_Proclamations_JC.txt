By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Throughout our Nation's history Americans of all faiths have turned to Divine Providence for the strength and wisdom to meet whatever challenges were put fore them with honor and dignity. 
The tasks we face today are as great as those faced by any generation of Americans. Our actions and choices will, for many years to come, affect not only ourselves but all the peoples with whom we share this tiny planet. 
It is therefore fitting that we set aside a day of prayer and meditation to ask the Almighty for the vision to see our duty as individuals and as a Nation and for the courage to pursue it, even at the cost of personal or collective sacrifice. 
Recognizing this, the Congress by joint resolution approved April 17, 1952 (36 U.S.C. 185; 66 Stat. 64) has called upon the President to set aside a suitable day each year as a National Day of Prayer. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Thursday, December 15, 1977, as National Day of Prayer. I ask all Americans to join with me on that day in asking God's help that we may see and understand our responsibilities and discharge them in a manner that befits a just and good people. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day October, in the year of our Lord hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second. 
JIMMY CARTER
