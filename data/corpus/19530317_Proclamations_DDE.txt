A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the men and women of the armed forces of the United States are constantly demonstrating their loyalty and devotion to the service of their country; and
Whereas
 these armed forces are now engaged in combat against ruthless aggression and despotism, which threaten to destroy the freedom that this Nation cherishes; and
Whereas
 these fighting forces help to maintain the strength and security of our Nation and to provide the power for peace needed in the world; and
Whereas
 it is fitting and proper that we devote one day each year to paying special tribute to those whose constancy and courage constitute one of the bulwarks guarding the freedom of this Nation and the peace of the free world:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 16, 1953, as Armed Forces Day; and I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury, on behalf of the Coast Guard, to mark the designated day with appropriate ceremonies, and to cooperate with other public authorities in suitable observances.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to provide for the celebration of the day in such manner as to pay suitable honor to the members of our armed forces; and I call upon my fellow citizens not only to display the flag of the United States on Armed Forces Day, but also to show their recognition of the gallantry, sacrifice, and devotion to duty of the men and women of the armed forces by cooperating in local observances of the day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
