WHEREAS section 4911(b) (3) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 fixes the rates of the interest equalization tax generally applicable in the case of acquisitions of stock and debt obligations made after January 25, 1967 and before August 30, 1967 at approximately 150 percent of the rates set forth in section 4911(b) (1) of the Code; and
WHEREAS the rates set forth in section 4911 (b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 would, in the absence of a determination made by the President under section 4911 (b) (2), be generally applicable in the case of acquisitions made on or after August 30, 1967; and
WHEREAS I have determined that the rates of tax prescribed in section 4911(b) (1) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954 are lower than the rates of tax necessary to limit the total acquisitions by United States persons of stock of foreign issuers and debt obligations of foreign obligors within a range consistent with the balance-of-payments objectives of the United States; and
WHEREAS it is now appropriate that Executive Order No. 11211, dated April 2, 1965 (effective April 5, 1965), relating to the exclusion from the interest equalization tax for original or new Japanese issues as required for international monetary stability, be modified;
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 4911 (b) (2) and 4917(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, by section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
