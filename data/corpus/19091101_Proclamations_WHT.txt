A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 one of the largest and most important of the early Spanish church ruins, commonly known as the Gran Quivira, together with numerous Indian pueblo ruins in its vicinity, situated in Socorro County, New Mexico, are of great historical interest, and it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving these ruins with as much public land as may be necessary for the proper protection thereof, 
Now, Therefore, I, William H. Taft,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by Section Two of the Act of Congress approved June 8, 1906, entitled, "an Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities", do hereby set aside as the Gran Quivira National Monument the Spanish church ruin and the Indian pueblo ruins situated in unsurveyed Township One South, Range Eight East of the New Mexico Principal Meridian, New Mexico, and located within and embracing all of the North half of the North half of Section Three of said township, containing one hundred and sixty acres of land, more or less, as shown upon the diagram hereto attached and made a part of this proclamation.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, excavate, injure or destroy any of the ruins or relics hereby declared to be a National Monument or to locate or settle upon any of the lands reserved and made a part of said monument by this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 1st day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nine, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-fourth. 
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT
