A Proclamation 
Burn injuries are one of the leading causes of accidental death in the United States. Every year, approximately two million people in this country are victims of burn injury and about twelve thousand of these victims die. 
The rehabilitative and psychological impact of burns is devastating. Children, the elderly, and the disabled are most likely to suffer serious burns. 
It is estimated that approximately 75 percent of all burns could be prevented by proper education of children and adults. Therefore, it is appropriate that all Americans have called to their attention the risks from burn accidents and the importance of burn prevention programs. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 234, has designated the week beginning February 9, 1986, as "National Burn Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of February 9, 1986, through February 15, 1986, as National Burn Awareness Week, and I call upon the people of the United States and all Federal, State, and local government officials to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
