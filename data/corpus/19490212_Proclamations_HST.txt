A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross serves as a medium through which the people of this Nation can participate effectively in the alleviation of human suffering whenever and wherever disaster strikes; and
Whereas
, specifically, the Red Cross expended $12,000,000 during the last fiscal year in helping 312,000 individuals whose communities had been ravaged by floods, fires, tornadoes, or other disasters; and 
Whereas
 the Red Cross stands at the side of our troops wherever they are stationed throughout the world, and also provides invaluable assistance to those war veterans who are still disabled or are maladjusted to civilian life; and
Whereas
, in order to help meet a growing post-war need, which would be multiplied in the event of a national emergency, this agency has inaugurated a national blood program intended to ensure eventually the availability of life-saving blood to the entire nation; and
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross through its 3,746 chapters contributes immeasurably to the health, welfare, and safety of our people and, acting in concert with its 65 sister societies, brings material comfort to the less fortunate of other lands; and
Whereas
 for the continuance of its missions of mercy in the next fiscal year the Red Cross is appealing for voluntary contributions amounting to $60,000,000:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate and proclaim the month of March 1949 as Red Cross Month; and I urge every citizen to respond during that month as generously as possible to the humanitarian appeal of this organization.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
