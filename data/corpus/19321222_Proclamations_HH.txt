A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Grand Canyon of the Colorado River is an object of unusual scientific interest, being the greatest eroded canyon within the United States; and 
Whereas
 that portion of the canyon which continues down the Colorado River below the Grand Canyon National Park contains much that is most significant and important in this unusual scientific interest; and 
Whereas
 it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving this portion of the Grand Canyon as a national monument, with such other land as is necessary for its proper protection; 
Now, Therefore, I, Herbert Hoover,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by section 2 of the act of Congress entitled "An Act For the preservation of American antiquities," approved June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225), do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing rights, there is hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws and set apart as a national monument, the tract of land in the State of Arizona, lying within the following-described boundaries, which shall hereafter be known as the Grand Canyon National Monument:
