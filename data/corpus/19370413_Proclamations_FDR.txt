A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 certain public lands in the State of Arizona contain historic landmarks, and have situated thereon various objects of historic and scientific interest; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve such lands as a national monument, to be known as the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (ch. 3060, 34 Stat. 225; U.S.C. title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that, subject to existing rights, the following-described lands in Arizona are hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public-land laws and set apart as the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument: 
Gila and Salt River Meridian 
Beginning at a point on the southern boundary of the Papago Indian Reservation which is the point for the corner of secs. 5, 6, 31, and 32, Tps. 17 and 18 S., R. 3 W.; thence south approximately five and one-half miles to the International Boundary; thence northwesterly along the International Boundary to the intersection with the position for the third meridional section line through unsurveyed T. 17 S., R. 8 W.; thence north on the third meridional section line through Tps. 17, 16, 15 and 14 S., R. 8 W. (unsurveyed), to the point for the corner of secs. 15, 16, 21 and 22; thence east on the third latitudinal section line through T. 14 S., Rs. 8, 7, 6, and 5 W., to the corner of sections 13, 18, 19 and 24, T. 14 S., Rs. 4 and 5 W., on the west boundary of the Papago Indian Reservation; thence southerly and easterly along the west boundary of the Papago Indian Reservation to the point for the corner of secs. 5, 6, 31, and 32, Tps. 17 and 18 S., R. 3 W., which is the point of beginning, containing approximately 330, 690 acres. 
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof. 
The Director of the National Park Service, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have the supervision, management, and control of the monument as provided in the act of Congress entitled "An Act to establish a National Park Service, and for other purposes," approved August 25, 1916 (ch. 408, 39 Stat. 535; U.S.C., title 16, secs. 1 and 2), and acts supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof: Provided, that the administration of the monument shall be subject to:
(1) Right of the Indians of the Papago Reservation to pick the fruits of the organ pipe cactus and other cacti, under such regulations as may be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior;
(2) Proclamation of May 27, 1907 (35 Stat. 2136); 
(3) Executive Order No. 5462 of October 14, 1930; and

The reservation made by this proclamation supersedes as to any of the above-described lands affected thereby the temporary withdrawal for classification and other purposes made by Executive Order No. 6910 of November 26, 1934, as amended. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
