By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons is a public international organization in which the United States participates within the meaning of the International Organization Immunities Act, I hereby designate the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such organization may have acquired or may acquire by international agreements, including the Chemical Weapons Convention, or by congressional action.
William J. Clinton
