A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 an American-flag Merchant Marine adequate for the needs of trade, travel, and defense promotes the economy and security of our Nation, which are vitally important factors in the stabilization of world conditions; and
Whereas
 the development and maintenance of such a Merchant marine depend upon public understanding and appreciation of its functions; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), designated May 22 as national Maritime Day in order to give recognition to the important role of the Merchant Marine by commemorating the anniversary of the first successful trans-oceanic voyage under steam propulsion, made by the steamship Savannah, which departed from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the request made by the Congress in the aforementioned resolution, do hereby set aside Monday, May 22, 1950, as national Maritime Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, I urge the people generally to fly the flag at their homes or other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on the appointed day, in honor of our merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 6th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
