By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As we pay homage again to the memory of General Casimir Pulaski, we are reminded of his dedication to freedom, his selfless service to our Nation, and his contributions to the achievement of American independence. His tireless devotion to democratic ideals continues to inspire us, his adopted countrymen, today. His name and deeds remain similarly alive in the hearts of the people of his native Poland, and indeed of people the world over. His is a model we can all emulate. 
Upon his arrival in America in 1777, General Pulaski was appointed by Congress as Commander of the Horse in the Continental Army. He fought at the battle of Germantown, conducted expeditions to obtain provisions for the Continental soldiers during their harsh winter at Valley Forge, Pennsylvania and, as the Revolutionary War continued, saw service in New Jersey and Delaware. Following a gallant attempt to wrest Savannah, Georgia from British control, this valiant patriot died on October 11, 1779. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate October 11, 1981 as General Pulaski Memorial Day. 
Furthermore, in recognition of the supreme sacrifice General Pulaski made for his adopted country and for the cause of freedom, I do hereby designate October 11 of each succeeding year as General Pulaski Memorial Day. 
I invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of General Pulaski by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies on this date in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
