By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Television has the power to shape thoughts, stir emotions, and inspire actions. It teaches, it sells, it entertains, it informs, and it has the capacity to influence powerfully the lives and values of our children. They learn much from television about the world, our society, and their place in it. 
Television can communicate values that are consistent with our heritage and traditions and can portray those actions and attitudes that make for better citizens. It also can depict themes that are destructive of these values. Recognizing that children are at a formative and vulnerable stage in their lives, many individuals and groups have a great interest in television programming. These concerned citizens are working to improve the quality of television programs viewed by their families. 
By Senate Joint Resolution 264 (P.L. 97443), the Congress has designated the week of March 13, 1983, through March 19, 1983, as "National Children and Television Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of March 13, 1983, through March 19, 1983, as "National Children and Television Week." I commend all those persons concerned about the quality of children's television programming, and I call upon all government agencies and the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate activities supporting television programs which are attentive to the needs and interests of children. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
