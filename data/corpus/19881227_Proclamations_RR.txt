By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
International law recognizes that coastal nations may exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction over their territorial seas. 
The territorial sea of the United States is a maritime zone extending beyond the land territory and internal waters of the United States over which the United States exercises sovereignty and jurisdiction, a sovereignty and jurisdiction that extend to the airspace over the territorial sea, as well as to its bed and subsoil. 
Extension of the territorial sea by the United States to the limits permitted by international law will advance the national security and other significant interests of the United States. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States of America, and in accordance with international law, do hereby proclaim the extension of the territorial sea of the United States of America, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, Guam, American Samoa, the United States Virgin Islands, the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and any other territory or possession over which the United States exercises sovereignty. 
The territorial sea of the United States henceforth extends to 12 nautical miles from the baselines of the United States determined in accordance with international law. 
In accordance with international law, as reflected in the applicable provisions of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, within the territorial sea of the United States, the ships of all countries enjoy the right of innocent passage and the ships and aircraft of all countries enjoy the right of transit passage through international straits.
Nothing in this Proclamation: 
(a) extends or otherwise alters existing Federal or State law or any jurisdiction, rights, legal interests, or obligations derived therefrom; or 
(b) impairs the determination, in accordance with international law, of any maritime boundary of the United States with a foreign jurisdiction. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.
RONALD REAGAN
