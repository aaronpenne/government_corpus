A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the outstanding accomplishments in the field of science and technology, especially in space exploration, electronics, peaceful use of atomic energy, and medical research, stagger the imagination and clearly and dramatically demonstrate the need for unceasing efforts to improve and expand our educational systems and educational facilities; and 
Whereas
 the ever-increasing complexities of modern-day living constantly challenge our ingenuity and compel us to set higher standards of educational achievement to meet that challenge and to assure national progress; and 
Whereas
 the efforts of our Nation's schools and colleges to provide the education and leadership required to preserve both freedom and peace, and to assure a full and abundant life for all people should be expressly recognized: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 11 through November 17, 1962, as American Education Week. 
Â I urge all citizens to give special attention during that week to the aims and purposes of education and the programs and problems of our schools and colleges. We should examine the quality of our educational institutions and assess the degree to which our educational programs and practices serve the interests of the individual and bring vitality and strength to our Nation and its culture. Every American should be fully committed to the advancement of education. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
