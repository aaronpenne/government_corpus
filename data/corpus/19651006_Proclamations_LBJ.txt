A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American consumer enjoys such a great abundance of farm products, manufactured goods, and services that his standard of living is the highest in the world; and
Whereas
 the urban citizen relies on the farmer for a never-ending flow of high quality farm products to feed, clothe, and shelter him; and
Whereas
 the farmer similarly looks to his fellow city workers for a myriad variety and quantity of manufactured goods, and the machines and power he needs for his work; and
Whereas
 farm and city workers have increased their efficiency to the extent that this Nation was able to produce a record 622 billion dollars worth of goods and services last year; and
Whereas
 the American consumer now spends a record low of about 181/2 per cent of his disposable income for food compared with 27 per cent during the late 1940's; and
Whereas
 this Nation's abundance now brings within our reach the world's first victory in the war against poverty and offers new hope to the. impoverished peoples of the world; and
Whereas
 our national effort to conserve and develop the Natural Beauty of America requires the cooperative action of all Americans, rural and urban:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of November 19 through November 25, 1965, as National Farm-City Week, and call upon citizens throughout the Nation to participate in observance of that week.
I request that leaders of civic associations, youth and women's clubs, farmers' organizations, business groups and labor unions, and all consumers join in this observance in appreciation of the important contributions that the farmer makes to the welfare of urban people, and the city worker to the welfare of people living on farms.
I urge the Department of Agriculture, land-grant colleges and universities, the cooperative extension service, and all appropriate Government officials to cooperate with national, State, and local organizations in carrying out programs to observe National Farm-City Week, including public meetings and exhibits and press, radio, and television features. I urge that such programs place emphasis on the responsibilities of rural and urban citizens in the war against poverty, in the creation of new jobs and new sources of income, in improving educational, medical, and other community services, and in developing and preserving the natural beauty of America.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
