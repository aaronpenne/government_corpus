By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Nowhere has the spirit of voluntarism shone more brightly than among the members of the United States Jaycees and its affiliated State and local organizations. Currently numbering more than 268,000 members and more than 6,500 chapters in 50 States, Jaycees have actively involved themselves in the life of our communities by providing leadership, rendering services, and returning the biblical hundredfold in a variety of endeavors. Their noteworthy contributions include such humanitarian projects as assistance to the elderly, fund-raising for the disadvantaged, cardiopulmonary resuscitation programs, energy conservation, and countless other efforts to address community needs. 
The heart and soul of the Jaycee philosophy may be found in its brief 65-word Creed:
"We believe:
That faith in God gives meaning and purpose to human life;
That the brotherhood of man transcends the sovereignty of nations;
That economic justice can best be won by free men through free enterprise;
That government should be of laws rather than of men;
That earth's great treasure lies in human personality;
And that service to humanity is the best work of life."
 
In recognition of the accomplishments of the United States Jaycees, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 213, has designated the week beginning January 19, 1986, as "National Jaycee Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 19, 1986, as National Jaycee Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that period with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
