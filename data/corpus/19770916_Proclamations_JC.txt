By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Exactly two centuries ago, in 1777, the Polish patriot Casimir Pulaski arrived on our shores to help secure the liberty of the American colonies. 
In exile from his native land, he fought courageously at Brandywine and in other battles. He formed and commanded the Pulaski Legion, the famous cavalry unit which contributed valiantly to the achievement of our independence. 
In October, 1779, General Pulaski died of wounds received in the siege of Savannah. In commemoration of his heroic sacrifice on behalf of American independence, our Nation has for generations paid grateful tribute to him and to the millions of Americans of Polish descent who have played a role of enduring significance in the life of our country. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 11, 1977, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of General Pulaski by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
