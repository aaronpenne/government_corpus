By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As a mark of respect for the American diplomats, military personnel and loyal staff members who died violently in the performance of their duty on April 18, 1983, in the tragic bombing of the United States Embassy in Beirut, Lebanon, I hereby order, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 175 of Title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions through Tuesday, April 26, 1983. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
