A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the high spiritual and humanitarian role of the Salvation Army has long been an important part of American life; and
Whereas
, through its welfare and religious institutions in our country, the Salvation Army has befriended, aided, and given new hope to men, women, and children, regardless of race or creed; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 31, 1954, 68 Stat. 997, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning November 28 as National Salvation Army Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 28, 1954, and ending December 4, 1954, as National Salvation Army Week; and I urge all of our citizens to honor the Salvation Army during that week for its work in the United States in the past seventy-five years. Let us remember that the banner of this organization, and the principles for which it stands, are stalwart bulwarks for the protection of the spiritual and physical needs of our people, and let us salute this great body of unselfish men and women during Salvation Army Week, with the knowledge that they have earned our esteem and praise in the fullest measure.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
