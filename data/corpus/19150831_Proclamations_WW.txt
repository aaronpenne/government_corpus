A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it appears that the public good will be promoted by excluding from the Cleveland National Forest, California, certain areas, and withdrawing a portion thereof for Mission Indian purposes, and by restoring the public lands subject to disposition in the remaining excluded areas in a manner authorized by the act of Congress approved September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and thirteen, entitled "An act to authorize the President to provide a method for opening lands restored from reservation or withdrawal, and for other purposes": 
Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by the act of Congress approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven (30 Stat., 11 at 34 and 36), entitled "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes," do proclaim that the boundaries of the Cleveland National Forest are hereby changed to exclude the areas indicated as eliminations on the diagram hereto annexed and forming a part hereof. 
And I do also proclaim that the south half of section twenty (20), in township three (3) south, range one (1) east, San Bernardino meridian, excluded from the Cleveland National Forest by this proclamation shall be, and is hereby, withdrawn from settlement, entry, sale, or other disposition under the public land laws of the United States and set aside for Mission Indian purposes. 
And I do further proclaim and make known that in my judgment it is proper and necessary in the interest of equal opportunity and good administration that all of the remaining excluded lands subject to disposition should be restored to settlement in advance of entry, and, pursuant to the authority reposed in me by the aforesaid act of September thirtieth, nineteen hundred and thirteen, I do hereby direct and provide that such lands, subject to valid rights and the provisions of existing withdrawals or reservations, shall be opened and become subject to settlement only, under the general provisions of the homestead laws, at and after, but not before, nine o'clock a.m. on the sixty-third day after the date of this proclamation; and to entry and other disposition, under any public land law applicable thereto, at and after, but not before, nine o'clock a.m. on the ninety-first day after said date. 
Persons who go upon any of the lands to be restored as herein provided and perform any act of settlement thereon from and including the date of this proclamation until nine o'clock a.m., standard time, on the sixty-third day from and after the date hereof, or who are on or are occupying any part of such lands at said hour, except those having valid subsisting settlement rights initiated prior to reservation and since maintained, and those having preferences to make entry under the provisions of the act of Congress approved June eleventh, nineteen hundred and six (34 Stat., 233), entitled "An act to provide for the entry of agricultural lands within forest reserves," and acts amendatory, will be considered and dealt with as trespassers and preference will be given the prior legal applicant, notwithstanding such unlawful settlement or occupancy: Provided, however, That nothing herein shall prevent persons from going upon and over the lands to examine them with a view to thereafter going upon and making settlement thereon when the lands shall become subject thereto in accordance with this proclamation. Persons having prior settlement rights or preferences, as above defined, will be allowed to make entry in conformity with existing law and regulations. 
It is not intended by this proclamation to reserve any land not immediately heretofore embraced in a national forest nor to exclude any land except the areas indicated as eliminations on the diagram hereto annexed. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the city of Washington this 31st day of August, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and fifteen, and of the independence of the United States the one hundred and fortieth. 
WOODROW WILSON. 
By the President: 
ROBERT LANSING, 
Secretary of State.
