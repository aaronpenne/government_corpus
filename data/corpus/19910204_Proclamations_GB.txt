By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. In Proclamation 5758 of December 24, 1987, the President determined, pursuant to sections 502(b)(7), 502(c)(7), and 504 of th,e Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 1974 Act) (b)(7), 2462(c)(7), 2462(c)(7), and 2464), that it was appropriate to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for articles that are eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Ghile. Such suspension was the result of a Presidential determination that Chile had not taken and was not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the 1974 Act (a)(4)). 
2. After a review of the current situation in Chile, I have determined that Chile has taken or is taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the 1974 Act. Further, pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act and 2462), and after taking into account the factors set forth in such sections, I have determined that it is appropriate to terminate the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Chile and to redesignate Chile as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. 
3. Pursuant to section 504 of the 1974 Act the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any article or with respect to any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the 1974 Act and 2462(c)). I have determined, pursuant to section 504(a) of the 1974 Act, the Chile should not receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles. 
4. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
