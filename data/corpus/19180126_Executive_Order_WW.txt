Every person who is a dealer upon the date hereof, as promptly as possible and in any event on or before January 31, 1918, shall file, with the Federal Reserve Board, through the Federal Reserve Bank of his district, an application for a registration certificate. Such application shall be in form approved by the Federal Reserve Board and shall show the character of business engaged in and whether or not an enemy or ally of enemy of the United States or any subject or citizen of an enemy or ally of enemy, wherever resident or domiciled, has any interest directly or indirectly in such business.

The Federal Reserve Board may issue to such applicant the appropriate registration certificate in form approved by it, entitling the holder to engage in the class or classes of foreign exchange or other transactions specified in such certificate, subject to all applicable provisions of law and to such Executive orders of the President and administrative regulations as shall have been issued or may from time to time be issued by the Federal Reserve Board. 
Any person who is not a dealer at the date hereof but who hereafter desires to become a dealer must first obtain a registration certificate. 
Any person, other than a customer, who does not desire to become a dealer but who nevertheless desires to engage in one or several transactions or to make one or several transfers described in the next preceding subdivision hereof, may be permitted by the Federal Reserve Board, in its discretion, to engage in any such transaction or to make any such transfer without first obtaining a registration certificate, and the Federal Reserve Board may likewise waive any requirement hereof, other than any which relates to trading with an enemy or ally of enemy, whether it is satisfied that such waiver is not incompatible with the best interests of the United States. 
Nothing herein shall be construed to abrogate or modify any existing requirement that licenses shall be obtained from the War Trade Board in respect of any transaction with, or for account of, an enemy or ally of enemy, or any person acting for, or on behalf of or for the benefit of, an enemy or ally of enemy. 
Revocation of registration certificates: Any or all such registration certificates may be revoked at any time by direction of the Secretary of the Treasury or of the Federal Reserve Board.

Such dealers will be required to report to the Federal Reserve Board only those foreign exchange transactions which are not included in the reports of such correspondents but may be called upon for any information in regard thereto desired by the Federal Reserve Board, and shall keep all books and records in a manner which will make it possible to furnish such information. 
Special reports: Whenever any holder of a registration certificate shall have reason to believe that any transaction within his knowledge involves or may involve directly or indirectly the payment of funds or delivery of securities to or the transfer of credit or securities for the benefit of an enemy or ally of enemy, or which may involve any other transaction with an enemy or ally of enemy, he shall immediately report the facts and circumstances to the Federal Reserve Board through a Federal Reserve Bank.

The Secretary of the Treasury may likewise prohibit the consummation of any such transaction by notice served on the parties in interest (either directly or through the Federal Reserve Board) in any case in which in his judgment the best interests of the United States require such action.
