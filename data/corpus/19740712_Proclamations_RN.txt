By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Consistent with the principles upon which this Nation was founded, we believe that democratic liberties are among the basic human rights to which all men are entitled. We do not seek to impose our beliefs upon others, but we do not hide our sympathies towards the desires of those who, like us, cherish liberty and self-determination. In support of this sentiment, the Eighty-Sixth Congress on July 17, 1959, by a joint resolution, authorized and requested the President to proclaim the third week in July in each year as Captive Nations Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 14, 1974, as Captive Nations Week.
I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge rededication to the cherished ideal of freedom for all.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth.
RICHARD NIXON
