By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
By Joint Resolution on July 17, 1959, the Eighty-Sixth Congress authorized and requested the designation of the third week of July as Captive Nations Week. Ten years have passed and there have been many changes in international affairs. But one thing that has not changed is the desire for national independence in Eastern Europe.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 13, 1969, as Captive Nations Week.
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to renew their devotion to the high ideals on which our nation was founded and has prospered and to sustain with understanding and sympathy the just aspirations of the peoples of all nations for independence and human freedom.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and for the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
