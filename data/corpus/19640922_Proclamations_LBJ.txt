By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 17, 1952, provided that the President "shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals": 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do set aside and proclaim Wednesday, the twenty-first of October, as the National Day of Prayer in the year 1964. 
Under our laws, 
--every man has the right to pray; 
--no man can be told how he must pray; 
--each man prays as his own conscience dictates. 
I call upon all of our citizens, therefore, to observe the National Day of Prayer in accordance with our custom-each in his own way and in his own faith. 
I urge that each of us turn to God on that day 
--acknowledging that our country continues, as it was founded, "with a firm reliance upon the protection of divine Providence"; 
--thanking Him for the blessings of mind and spirit which He has heaped upon us in a land of vast bounty; 
--begging His forgiveness for our shortcomings; 
--asking for the patience, the wisdom, the understanding, and the courage we need to carry on His work. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State.
