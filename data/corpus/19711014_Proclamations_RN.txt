By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
From 1923, when Fiddlin' John Carson made the first tremendously successful country recording until today when country sounds can be heard on over 700 radio stations, the popularity of country music has been a notable part of our American culture.
Why is country music so popular? Why is the Grand Ole Opry's audience made up of people who have traveled an estimated average of 450 miles one way to be there?
The answer is simple. Country music speaks to what is tried and true for many Americans. It speaks of the common things shared by all: the happiness of a family, the pains of a broken heart, the mercy of God, and the goodness of man.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, ask the people of this Nation to mark the month of October, 1971, with suitable observances as Country Music Month.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 14th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
