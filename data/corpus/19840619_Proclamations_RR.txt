By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
America's growth and prosperity depend on the full participation of all its citizens. If we as a Nation are to remain the world's leader in innovation, technology and productivity, we must ensure that all Americans are involved in our economic progress. 
The fulfillment of this challenge has become more realistic today, because of the significant contributions of minority American entrepreneurs to our economy. The Nation's 600,000 minority-owned businesses reveal the true meaning of entrepreneurship. They have emerged as a dynamic force in the marketplace, bringing innovative products and services to our economy, and constituting the principal source for jobs and training for thousands of American workers. 
As we enter an era of greatly expanded opportunities in economic growth and development, it is appropriate that we encourage minority business owners by recognizing their tremendous contributions toward the continued economic development of our Nation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 7 through October 13, 1984, as Minority Enterprise Development Week, and I urge all Americans to join together with the minority business enterprises of our Nation in appropriate observances. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
