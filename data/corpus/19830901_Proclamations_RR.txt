By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As a mark of respect for the American citizens and all those who died violently on board the Korean Airlines flight which was ruthlessly shot down by Soviet fighters between Sakhalin and Monoron Islands on September 1, 1983, I hereby order, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions through Sunday, September 4, 1983. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
