By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the earth mounds in the northeastern part of the State of Iowa known as the Effigy Mounds are of great scientific interest because of the variety of their forms, which include animal effigy, bird effigy, conical, and linear types, illustrative of a significant phase of the mound-building culture of the prehistoric American Indians; and 
Whereas
 the Advisory Board on National Parks, Historic Sites, Buildings, and Monuments at its meeting held October 28-30, 1941 declared the Effigy Mounds to be of national scientific importance; and 
Whereas
 the State of Iowa has acquired title to 1,204.39 acres of land containing these unusual objects, and has conveyed 1,000 acres thereof to the United States as a donation for national-monument purposes, such conveyance having been accepted on behalf of the United States by the Acting Director of the National Park Service on August 31, 1949; and 
Whereas
 it is contemplated that the State of Iowa will convey the remaining 204.39 acres of such land to the United States for national monument purposes in the near future; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to set aside and reserve the said land as a national monument as hereinafter indicated: 
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that, subject to all valid existing rights, the lands within the following-described boundaries and shown on the diagram hereto attached and forming a part hereof which belong to the United States are hereby reserved and established as a national monument, to be known as the Effigy Mounds National Monument; and that the lands within such boundaries which do not now belong to the United States shall become a part of such monument upon the acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
