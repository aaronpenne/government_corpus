By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In the midst of our struggle for independence the Continental Congress, meeting in York, Pennsylvania, recognized that the new Nation would require a permanent central government. Not only was unity necessary if that struggle was to be successfully concluded, but it was essential if the new Nation was to be able to deal effectively with such matters as regulating trade, disposing of western lands, and controlling finance. 
Although the colonists shared a common heritage and spoke a common language, their customs, traditions and economic needs varied. Because of this their loyalties were regional in nature. These differences were overcome and, on November 15, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted the Articles of Confederation. 
The Articles of Confederation became our first constitution and served the new Nation from 1781, when they were ratified, until 1789. Much of what we learned about government during that period became part of our Constitution and our heritage.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, November 15, 1977, as a Day of National Observance of the Two Hundredth Anniversary of the Adoption of the Articles of Confederation by the Continental Congress convened in York, Pennsylvania, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
