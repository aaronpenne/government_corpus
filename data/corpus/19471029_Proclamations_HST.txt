A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 now, as ever, men of good will are dedicated to the prevention of armed conflict between nations and to the guidance of mankind into paths of peace; and
Whereas
 it is a wise and wholesome custom to rededicate ourselves to this task on November 11 of each year, the anniversary of the laying down of weapons in the first great war of this century; and
Whereas
 the Congress, in recognition of this opportunity for strengthening our peaceful purposes, passed a concurrent resolution on June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), calling for the observance of November 11 of each year with appropriate ceremonies; and
Whereas
 it is provided by an act of Congress approved on May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), that the eleventh day of November in each year shall be celebrated and known as armistice day and shall be a legal public holiday:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to devote themselves anew on Tuesday, November 11, 1947, in schools and churches or other suitable places, to the grateful use of the peace we now enjoy in our beloved country, after a second world holocaust, and to the work of promoting with zeal and fervor a permanent peace among all the peoples of the earth; and I call upon the officials of the Government to have the flag of the United States flown upon all public buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
