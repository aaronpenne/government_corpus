By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On May 20, 1932, Amelia Earhart set out from Harbour Grace, Newfoundland, to conquer the air lanes across the Atlantic Ocean. Fifteen hours later, she landed safely in Ireland to become the first woman to pilot an airplane across the Atlantic. 
Pioneer aviatrix, adventurer, journalist, and nurse, Amelia Earhart captured the hearts of the American people with her daring exploits. She encouraged the development of commercial aviation, then a fledgling industry, and paved the way for women to enter the field of aviation. She set many speed and altitude records in airplanes and autogiros, the forerunner to the helicopter, and was the first woman to be awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. 
In June 1937, Amelia Earhart attempted the first round-the-world flight near the equator with her co-pilot, Frederick J. Noonan, in a twin-engined Lockheed Electra. On July 2, during their flight from New Guinea to Howland Island in the Central Pacific, trouble developed aboard the aircraft. Radio contact was lost, and no trace of either the plane or its crew was ever found. 
Recognizing the great accomplishments of Amelia Earhart, the Congress has by joint resolution (H.J. Res. 412) called upon the President to designate May 20, 1982, as "Amelia Earhart Day" as a tribute to the most daring and celebrated of the pioneer women aviators. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 20, 1982, as Amelia Earhart Day. 
I call upon Federal, State, and local government agencies and the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
