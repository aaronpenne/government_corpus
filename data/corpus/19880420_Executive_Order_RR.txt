Establishing an Emergency Board to Investigate a Dispute Between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and Certain of its Employees Represented by the United Transportation Union 
A dispute exists between the Chicago and North Western Transportation Company and certain of its employees represented by the United Transportation Union. 
The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended ("the Act"). 
This dispute, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service. 
Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Establishment of Board. There is established, effective April 22, 1988, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds. 
Sec. 2. Report. The board shall report its finding to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days from the date of its creation. 
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 10 of the Act, as amended, from the date of the creation of the board and for 30 days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement of the parties, shall be made by the Carrier or the employees in the conditions out of which the dispute arose. 
Sec. 4. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in Section 2 of this Order.
