A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261 (7 U.S.C. 624), I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation to determine whether almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashew nuts are being, or are practically certain to be, imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, certain programs or operations undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program or operation is being undertaken; and
Whereas
 the Commission has made such investigation in accordance with the provisions of the said section 22 and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas
, on the basis of such investigation and report of the Commission, I find that shelled almonds and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) are practically certain to be imported into the United States during the period from October 1, 1951, to September 30, 1952, both dates inclusive, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, a program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended: and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of a fee as hereinafter specified ins shown by such investigation of the Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of imported shelled almonds and of blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) will not render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the said program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby impose and proclaim a fee of 10 cents per pound but not more than 50 per centum ad valorem on any shelled almonds and on any blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period from October 1, 1951, to September 30, 1952 both dates inclusive, in excess of an aggregate quantity of 4,500,000 pounds: Provided, that any blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during such period in excess of an aggregate quantity of 500,000 pounds shall not be included in the aforesaid aggregate quantity of 4,500,000 pounds, but shall be subject to the fee of 10 cents per pound but not more than 50 per centum ad valorem: And provided further, that no fee shall be assessed or collected by virtue of this proclamation on any article entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to the close of business on the date of this proclamation.
The fee imposed by this proclamation shall be in addition to any other duty imposed on the importation of the articles subject to such fee.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this Tenth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
