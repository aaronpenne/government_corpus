By virtue of the authority vested in me by sections 204 and 501(d) of the Career Compensation Act of 1949, as amended (37 U.S.C. 235, 301(d)), and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Section 6 of Executive Order No. 10152 of August 17, 1950, is amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 6. Members who, pursuant to competent orders, are attached to a submarine which is in an active status, including a submarine under construction from the time builders' trials commence, shall be entitled to receive incentive pay for the performance of submarine duty. The term "builders' trials" shall be construed to mean trials conducted underway or in free route. A member who, pursuant to competent orders, performs duty as an operator or crew member of an operational, self-propelled submersible, including undersea exploration and research vehicles, shall likewise be entitled to receive incentive pay for the performance of submarine duty. In the case of nuclear-powered submarines this entitlement shall include periods of training and rehabilitation after assignment thereto as determined by the Secretary of the Navy."
SEC. 2. This order shall become effective as of July 12, 1960.
