A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the European Economic Community maintains unreasonable import restrictions upon imports of poultry from the United States; 
Whereas
 such unreasonable import restrictions directly and substantially burden United States commerce; 
Whereas
 products of the European Economic Community receive benefits of trade agreement concessions made by the United States; 
Whereas
 it is consistent with the purposes expressed in Section 102 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1801) for the United States to suspend the application of the benefits of certain of those trade agreement concessions; 
Whereas
, having due regard for the international obligations of the United States, particularly paragraph 3 of Article XXXVIII of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade* requiring any suspension of trade agreement concessions to be made on a most-favored nation basis, I am taking steps to suspend, on a most-favored-nation basis, certain trade agreement concessions in the United States schedules to that Agreement; and 
Whereas
 rates of duty suspended by this proclamation will not be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement on and after January 7, 1964: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including Section 252(c) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(c and Section 350(a) (6 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1351(a) (6)), and in order to suspend the application of the benefits of certain trade agreement concessions, do hereby proclaim (until such time as the President of the United States of America otherwise proclaims)
