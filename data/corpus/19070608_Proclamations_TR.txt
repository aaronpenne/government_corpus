By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Act of Congress approved April 27, 1904, (33 Stats., 319, 324) providing for the disposition of lands in the former Devil's Lake Indian Reservation in North Dakota, under the general provisions of the homestead and townsite laws of the United States, at the price of Four Dollars and Fifty Cents per acre, which lands were opened by Proclamation of June 2, 1904, (33 Stats., 2368, 2372), provides that when in the judgment of the President no more of the lands can be disposed of at the said price, he may by proclamation, sell the remaining lands under such laws, at such price and upon such terms as he may deem best for all interests concerned. 
And, Whereas,
 it appears that such tracts of said lands now remaining undisposed of, are small in acreage, or hilly and stony and cannot be disposed of at the price named; 
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the authority in me vested by said Act of April 27, 1904, do hereby declare and make known that such of said lands as are unreserved and undisposed of shall on and after date hereof be subject to disposition under the general provisions of the homestead, townsite laws and of Sec. 2455 R.S., as amended by Act of Congress, approved June 27, 1906, (34 Stats., 517), at the price of not less than Two Dollars and Fifty Cents per acre in cash payable at date of final proof upon entries made under the homestead and townsite laws and at time of sale under Sec. 2455, Amended. In addition, entrymen must pay the same fees and commissions now required by said laws where the price of land is One Dollar and Twenty Five Cents per acre. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-first.
