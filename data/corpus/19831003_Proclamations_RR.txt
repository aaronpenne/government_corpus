By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
America's future is dependent upon the health and vitality of her education system. Although thousands of businesses, industries, individuals, organizations, teachers, administrators, and government at all levels have been involved in the education of our youth, there is more work to be done. More people must become active in improving the quality of education in our Nation. 
Recently, many schools have developed private sector partnerships in an effort to broaden available resources and reach out to their communities for support. The private sector has much to offer the growing national movement to improve our education system. Some of the most effective methods include helping educators identify the learning needs of our society; encouraging professional exchanges between teachers, educators, and businesses; contributing expertise, financial resources, and equipment; and providing technical assistance in school administration and curriculum development. In order to encourage this trend, I call upon businesses, organizations, individuals, and agencies to become involved with their local schools. 
Partnerships in Education Year gives us the opportunity to acknowledge the efforts of the private sector and to encourage the creation of new partnerships in education all across this Nation. 
Now, Therein)re, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period from October 1, 1983, through June 30, 1984, as the National Year of Partnerships in Education. I invite all Americans to join me in my commitment to the excellence and quality of education offered to all Americans. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 3rd day of Oct., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
