A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the long-term housing shortage and the war have combined to create an unprecedented emergency shortage of housing, particularly for veterans of World War II and their families; and
Whereas
 section 1 of the Veterans' Emergency Housing Act of 1946 recognizes the aforesaid unprecedented emergency; and
Whereas
 it is imperative that immediate action be taken on a temporary basis to increase the available supplies of timber, lumber, and lumber products for housing purposes:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, and in particular by section 318 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (46 Stat. 590, 696), do hereby declare an emergency to exist, and do hereby authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to permit, until the termination of the provisions of the Veterans' Emergency Housing Act of 1946, or until the President shall have declared that the emergency declared herein has terminated, whichever shall first occur, under such regulations and subject to such conditions as the Secretary may deem necessary, the importation free of duty of any articles which the Housing Expediter designates and certifies as timber, lumber, or lumber products suitable for the construction or completion of housing accommodations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
