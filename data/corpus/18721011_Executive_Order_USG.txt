DEPARTMENT OF STATE
The undersigned is charged by the President with the painful duty of announcing to the people of the United States the death of an illustrious citizen.
William Henry Seward, distinguished for faithful and eminent service in varied public trusts during a long series of years, died at Auburn, in the State of New York, yesterday, October 10. Charged with the administration of the Department of State at a most critical period in the history of the nation, Mr. Seward brought to the duties of that office exalted patriotism, unwearied industry, and consummate ability. A grateful nation will cherish his name, his fame, and his memory.
The several Executive Departments will cause appropriate honors to be rendered to the memory of the deceased statesman at home and abroad.
HAMILTON FISH,
 Secretary of State.
