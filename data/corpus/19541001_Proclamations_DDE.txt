A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the courageous voyage on which Christopher Columbus embarked over four and one-half centuries ago opened to our ancestors the untold opportunities of this new Continent; and
Whereas
 the discovery of Christopher Columbus led to the settlement of our land and, ultimately, to the birth of our nation; and
Whereas
 it is therefore especially fitting that the memory of this great Admiral be accorded appropriate recognition each year by the people of this Nation; and
Whereas
, in commemoration of the achievement of this intrepid explorer, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year, the anniversary of the discovery of America, as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 12, 1954, as Columbus Day, and I invite all the people of our Nation to observe this anniversary with appropriate ceremonies. I also call upon officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on the twelfth day of October in honor of the memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 1st day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
