A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the teaching and the practice of fire prevention are of invaluable assistance in saving lives and protecting property throughout the Nation; and
Whereas
 enormous losses can be avoided through effective fire-prevention measures; and
Whereas
 fire-prevention programs meet vital community needs and should be the concern of all our people:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 7, 1956, as Fire Prevention Week.
I call upon our people to join in effective programs to promote safety in the control of fire; and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public-information agencies, to share actively in observing Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national effort to reduce the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
