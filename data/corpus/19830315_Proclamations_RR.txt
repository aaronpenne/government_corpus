By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
It was once written that America is great because it is good, and if America ever ceases to be good, America will cease to be great. So long as Americans remain faithful—in deeds as well as thought—to the ideals embodied in our Constitution and furthered in our free institutions, our Nation's greatness will flourish. 
Americans have fought, and many have died, to preserve the blessings of liberty in this fair land. Each of us has the opportunity to honor these sacrifices and to renew our commitment to American ideals as we go about our daily lives. When we participate in a free election, extend a helping hand to a neighbor, live responsible and productive lives, or teach a child through our own actions that all people are equal under the law, we manifest our allegiance to this great country. 
We must never take our precious freedoms for granted. Rather, from time to time we must rededicate ourselves to the magnificent ideals of our great democracy-liberty, justice, and dignity for all mankind. 
For this purpose, the Congress, by joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369; 36 U.S.C. 162), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, a day for reflection upon our national institutions, our heritage of freedom, and what it means to be an American. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, May 1, 1983, as Loyalty Day and call upon all Americans and patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies. 
I call upon all government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings and grounds on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 15th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
