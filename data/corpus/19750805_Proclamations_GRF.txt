A Proclamation
 
TERMINATION OF TEMPORARY QUANTITATIVE LIMITATION ON THE IMPORTATION INTO THE UNITED STATES OF CERTAIN CATTLE, SWINE AND PORK FROM CANADA 
Whereas,
 Proclamation No. 4335 of November 16, 1974, limiting imports into the United States of certain cattle, beef, veal, swine and pork from Canada, was issued pursuant to Section 252 (a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(a)) in response to Canada's imposing unjustifiable restrictions on cattle and meat imports from the United States, said Proclamation inserting item numbers 945.01 through 945.04 into subpart B of part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), and 
Whereas,
 Canada has now lifted those unjustifiable restrictions on cattle imports from the United States, and 
Whereas,
 Section 255(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885(b) ) authorizes the President to terminate in whole or in part any proclamation made pursuant to Section 252 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882 (a) ), and 
Whereas,
 I deem it necessary and appropriate to terminate in part the restrictions proclaimed in Proclamation No. 4335, specifically those imposing temporary quantitative limitations on the importation into the United States of certain cattle, swine and pork from Canada, in order to encourage the resolution of trade disputes between the United States and Canada, 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, acting under authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 255(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885(b) ) do hereby proclaim that: 
1) So much of Proclamation No. 4335 as proclaimed temporary quantitative limitations on the importation into the United States of certain cattle, swine, and pork from Canada is terminated. 
2) Subpart B of part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is amended as follows: 
(a) By deleting from the superior heading immediately preceding item 945.01 the following: 
(i)       "the cattle, the swine," 
(ii)     ",or the pork" 
(iii)    "cattle, swine," 
(iv)   "or pork, respectively," 
(b) By deleting items 945.01, 945.02, and 945.04. 
3) This Proclamation is effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after 12:01 a.m., EDT, August 7, 1975. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two-hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
