By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Secretaries to lawyers and judges play an important role in our judicial system, providing competent, dedicated and loyal service to the leaders of the bar.
Many legal secretaries, however, have never visited a court and observed justice in action. In order that they may have an opportunity to do so, and in the belief that such visits can further a legal secretary's understanding, interest, and efficiency in her work, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 807, has requested the President to designate the second full week in October, 1972, as National Legal Secretaries' Court Observance Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 8, 1972, as National Legal Secretaries' Court Observance Week. I call upon the people of the United States, particularly the legal community, to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
