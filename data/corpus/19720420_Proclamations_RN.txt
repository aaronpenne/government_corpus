By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The task of cleansing our environment calls for individual effort on the part of all Americans.
Under the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1970, we can look forward to the day when pollutants from new motor vehicles will be substantially diminished. Setting emission standards, however, is not all that we can do. Our citizens can also act now to limit exhaust pollutants entering our atmosphere from motor vehicles currently in use.
Aware of the opportunity and the responsibility of Americans to help purify the air, the Congress, by Joint Resolution, has requested the President to designate April, 1972 as National Check Your Vehicle Emissions Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April, 1972 to be National Check Your Vehicle Emissions Month, and I call upon all Americans to recognize the need for curbing exhaust pollutants from their motor vehicles by maintaining them in good working order.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
