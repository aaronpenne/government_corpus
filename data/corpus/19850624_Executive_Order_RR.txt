App. 2061 et seq.), as amended by Public Law 98-265, and in order to provide for the performance of certain reporting functions with respect to the effect of offsets on international trade, it is hereby ordered that Section 602 of Executive Order No. 10480 of August 14, 1953, as amended, is further amended by adding the following new subsection: 
"(d) (1) The functions conferred upon the President by Section 309 of the Defense Production Act, as amended, with respect to the preparation and submission of reports to the Congress concerning offsets shall be performed by the Director of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The Director may further delegate to the heads of Executive departments and agencies responsibility for preparing and submitting for his review particular sections of such reports. The heads of Executive departments and agencies shall, to the extent provided by law, provide the Director with such information as may be necessary for the effective performance of these functions.
