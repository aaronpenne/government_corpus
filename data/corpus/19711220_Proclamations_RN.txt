Whereas
, in order to impose a surcharge required by the balance of payments position of the United States,
Proclamation 4074, dated August 15, 1971, terminated in part for such period as necessary prior Presidential Proclamations insofar as such proclamations were inconsistent with, or proclaimed duties different from, those made effective pursuant to the terms of Proclamation 4074;
Whereas
, a multilateral agreement has been reached among the Group of Ten major industrial nations which permits removal of the surcharge;
Whereas
, under section 350(a) (6) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (hereinafter referred to as "the Tariff Act"), and section 255 (b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (hereinafter referred to as "the TEA"), and other authority, the President may, at any time, terminate, in whole or in part, for such period as may be necessary, any proclamation, issued pursuant to section 350 of the Tariff Act or Title II of the TEA;
Whereas
, under section 350(a) (1) (B) of the Tariff Act and section 201(a) (2) of the TEA, the President may proclaim modifications of any existing duty as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out trade agreements entered into under the authority of those Acts; and
Whereas
, I hereby determine that modification of existing duties to restore the rates of duty applicable on August 15, 1971, terminated in part for such period as necessary by Proclamation 4074, is required or appropriate to carry out such trade agreements;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
