By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On August 26, 1920, the 19th Amendment to the Constitution became law, granting women the right to vote. On this, the 61st anniversary of that milestone, all Americans should reflect on the progress we have made toward the goal of equal opportunity. 
Since ratification of the 19th Amendment, women have played increasingly important roles in guiding the Nation's basic institutions. While women continue to fulfill the irreplaceable and vitally important roles of wife and mother, increasing numbers of them have entered the professions and the work place as well, making steady, significant progress over the years. 
Today, women faithfully shoulder responsibilities at all levels of government and in every area of employment and education and are opening up new opportunities every day. On this occasion, it is fitting that we honor the contributions women have made to every aspect of our development as a Nation and rededicate ourselves to maintaining a society in which the rights of all citizens are protected. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1981, as Women's Equality Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
