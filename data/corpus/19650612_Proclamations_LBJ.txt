A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American flag has symbolized the strength, honor, ideals, and national aspirations of this country since 1777; and 
Whereas
 people of many nationalities and religious beliefs have abandoned their worldly possessions and have fled their homelands, often at great risk to their lives, in order to find a haven, under our flag, from tyranny and oppression; and 
Whereas
 Americans have worked, fought, and sacrificed to the end that they and their fellow citizens might continue to enjoy the life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness which constitute the heritage of every American and all free men; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day in commemoration of the adoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Monday, June 14, 1965, in observance of Flag Day and I call upon all fellow Americans to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies designed to honor our national emblem. 
I urge every citizen to pledge once more his allegiance to our flag and to rededicate himself to the principles and ideals for which it is an inspiring tangible symbol. I also urge every American to remember the valiant sacrifices made by our forefathers and patriots through the years-both soldiers and civilians-in the name of our flag in order that our Nation might continue to be "the land of the free and the home of the brave." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

DEAN RUSK, 
Secretary of State.
