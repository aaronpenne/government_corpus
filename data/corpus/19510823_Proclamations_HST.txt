A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 over four and a half centuries ago, Christopher Columbus, with undaunted courage, traversed the uncharged Atlantic and discovered a new world; and
Whereas
 the saga of his exploits has stirred the imagination of men throughout the centuries and has inspired many other quests for larger horizons; and
Whereas
, in the present century, the new and old worlds, to whose unity Christopher Columbus contributed so much, are striving toward further unity through the closer association of free peoples; and
Whereas
 in the exploration of uncharted ways toward such unity we may take guidance from the life and deeds of Christopher Columbus; and
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657(), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, by this proclamation designate Friday, October 12, 1951, as Columbus Day, and I direct the appropriate officials to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of this country to observe the day with ceremonies designed to honor the discoverer of America.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 23d day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
