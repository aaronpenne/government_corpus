A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Yellowstone Forest Reserve, in the State of Wyoming, was established by proclamation dated May 22, 1902, under the provisions of the acts of March 3, 1891, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," and June 4, 1897, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1898, and for other purposes," superseding the Yellowstone Park Timber Land Reserve;
And Whereas,
 the public lands in the State of Wyoming, hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and resenting said lands;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there is hereby reserved from entry or settlement, and added to and made a part of the aforesaid Yellowstone Forest Reserve, all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Wyoming and particularly described as follows, to wit:
Sections one (1), two (2) and three (3), township forty-eight (48) north, range one hundred and four (104) west; and all of township forty-nine (49) north, range one hundred and four (104) west, sixth (6th) Principal Meridian, Wyoming.
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired:
 Provided,
 that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington, this thirteenth day of June, A. D. 1902, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-sixth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
