By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to Section 201(d)(I) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2251(d)(1)), the United States International Trade Commission (USITC), on August 18, 1980, reported to the President (USITC Report 201-43) the results of its investigation under section 201 (b) of the Trade Act ( 19 U.S.C. 2251(b)). The USITC determined that mushrooms, prepared or preserved, provided for in item 144.20 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202), are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury, or the threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing an article like or directly competitive with the imported article. The USITC recommended the imposition of quantitative restrictions on imports of the above specified mushrooms. 
2. On October 17, 1980, pursuant to section 202(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), I determined to remedy the injury, or threat thereof, found to exist by the USITC by proclaiming a temporary duty increase. On October 17, 1980, in accordance with section 203 (b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (b) (1)), I transmitted a report to the Congress setting forth my determination and intention to proclaim a temporary duty increase and stating the reason why my decision differed from the action recommended by the USITC. 
3. Section 203(e) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e) (1)) requires that import. relief be proclaimed and take effect within 15 days after the import relief determination date. 
4. Pursuant to sections 203 (a) (1) and 203(e) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a) (1) and 2253(e) (1)), I am providing import relief through the temporary increase of the import duty on the subject mushrooms. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 604 and 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483 and 2253), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), do proclaim that? 
(i) Part I of Schedule XX to the GATT is modified to conform to the actions taken in the Annex to this Proclamation. 
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this Proclamation. 
(3) This Proclamation shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption on or after November 1, 1980, and before the close of October 31, 1983, unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly suspended, modified or terminated. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth. 
JIMMY CARTER
