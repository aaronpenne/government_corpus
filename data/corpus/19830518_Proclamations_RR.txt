By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Dr. Andrei Sakharov has earned the admiration and gratitude of the people of the United States and other countries throughout the world for his tireless and courageous efforts on behalf of international peace and on behalf of basic human freedoms for the peoples of the Soviet Union. In recognition of this work, Dr. Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Prize for Peace. Soviet authorities prevented Dr. Sakharov from receiving this award in person by prohibiting him from leaving the Soviet Union. 
In the face of continuous harassment and mistreatment by the Soviet authorities, Dr. Sakharov has continued his work for peace and individual human rights. Despite his exile to the remote city of Gorkiy on January 22, 1980, and despite continued efforts by the Soviet authorities to deny Dr. Sakharov the means of continuing his work and of maintaining contact with the outside world, the example of Andrei Sakharov's courage continues to shine brightly. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 51, has designated May 21, 1983 as "National Andrei Sakharov Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that day. On this occasion, Americans everywhere are given the opportunity to reaffirm that, despite attempts at repression, the ideals of peace and freedom will endure and ultimately triumph. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 21, 1983 as National Andrei Sakharov Day. I call upon the American people to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
