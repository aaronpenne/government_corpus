By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Today a senseless act of violence has robbed the United States of a close friend and robbed the world of a statesman and courageous champion of peace.
Yitzhak Rabin was a brave man who defended his country for half a century and whose vision and tenacity brought the world closer to peace.
He was a man of hope, a man of wisdom, a man who sought to improve the lives of all those he touched.
The peace process that he began will be his legacy. The people of the United States and the peace-loving people of the world are determined that the peace process will go forward.
As a mark of respect for the memory of Yitzhak Rabin and America's support for peace in the Middle East, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States Embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
