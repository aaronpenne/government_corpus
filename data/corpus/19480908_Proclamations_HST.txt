A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 18, 1948, is the first anniversary of the autonomous United States Air Force; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that our people pay tribute to the men and women, both living and dead, who have contributed to the growth of American air power; and
Whereas
 the United States Air Force is maintaining high standards of proficiency through constant research and development in the field of aviation and through peacetime training of personnel for its mission; and
Whereas
 a grateful nation recognizes the increasing importance of air power in preserving our democratic way of life, in assuring the physical security of our country, and in helping to safeguard international peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, September 18, 1948, as Air Force Day, and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
I earnestly request that the people of the United States observe Air Force Day by participating in the programs scheduled at Air Force Bases and by attending civic-sponsored Air Force events. I invite the State and local governments, as well as patriotic and civic organizations and the agencies of the press, the radio, and the motion-picture industry, to cooperate fully in this observance. I also direct that the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government assist in every feasible way in the celebration of Air Force Day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
