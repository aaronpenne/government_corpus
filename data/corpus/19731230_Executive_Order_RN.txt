Whitney Gillilland, Vice Chairman of the Civil Aeronautics Board, will, during the month of January, 1974, become subject to mandatory retirement for age under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code unless exempted therefrom by Executive order.
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Gillilland be exempted from such mandatory requirement.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Whitney Gillilland from mandatory retirement for age until December 31, 1974.
RICHARD NIXON
