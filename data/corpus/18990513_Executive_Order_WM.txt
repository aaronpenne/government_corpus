In the exercise of the power conferred upon me by the joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President on July 7, 1898, entitled "Joint Resolution to provide for annexing the Hawaiian Islands to the United States" the President of the United States hereby directs that the General Election provided for by the constitution of the Republic of Hawaii to be held on the last Wednesday in September next shall not be held. All elective officers whose terms of office shall expire before appropriate legislation shall have been enacted by the Congress of the United States shall be continued in their offices at the pleasure of the President of the United States.
In witness whereof I have caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY
