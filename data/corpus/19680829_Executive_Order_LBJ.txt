"SECTION 101. For the purposes of these regulations:
"(a) The term 'aerial flight' shall be construed to mean flight in an aircraft, glider, or spacecraft; and a flight shall be deemed to begin when the aircraft, glider, or spacecraft takes off from rest at any point of support located on the surface of the earth and to terminate when it next comes to a complete stop at a point of support located on the surface of the earth.
"(b) The term 'aviation accident' shall be construed to mean an accident in which a member who is required to participate frequently and regularly in aerial flight is injured or otherwise incapacitated as the result, as attested by the appropriate medical authority of the uniformed service concerned, of (1) jumping from, being thrown from, or being struck by, an aircraft, glider, or spacecraft, or any part or auxiliary thereof, or (2) participation in any duly authorized aerial flight or other aircraft, glider, or spacecraft operations."
