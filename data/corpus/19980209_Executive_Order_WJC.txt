By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and in order to reflect the appropriate allocation of funding responsibilities for Noncombatant Evacuation Operations, it is hereby ordered that Executive Order 12656 is amended by adding a new section 501(16) to read as follows:
"Subject to the direction of the President, and pursuant to procedures to be developed jointly by the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of State, be responsible for the deployment and use of military forces for the protection of United States citizens and nationals and, in connection therewith, designated other persons or categories of persons, in support of their evacuation from threatened areas overseas."
