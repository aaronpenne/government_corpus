WHEREAS there exist certain labor disputes between Kennecott Copper Corporation, Phelps Dodge Corporation, American Smelting and Refining Company, Anaconda Copper Mining Company, including International Smelting and Refining Company, and other employers who are similarly engaged in mining, milling, smelting, or refining copper or other non-ferrous metals and certain of their employees represented by certain labor organizations, including the International Union of Mine, Mill and Smelter Workers, several Railroad Brotherhoods, and unions affiliated with the American Federation of Labor; and
WHEREAS in my opinion such disputes have resulted, or threaten to result, in strikes or lockouts affecting a substantial part of the copper and non-ferrous metals industry, an industry engaged in trade and commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, and in the production of goods for commerce, which strikes or lockouts, if permitted to occur or continue, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW. THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Public Law 101, 80th Congress), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such disputes.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before September fourth, 1951.
Upon the submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
