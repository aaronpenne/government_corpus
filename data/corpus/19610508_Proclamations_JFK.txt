A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the strength of our Nation depends upon the strength of the American home, where the spiritual, physical, and intellectual development of our children is begun and fostered; and 
Whereas
 the American mother, as the heart of the American home, by her labor and love instills in our homes and nurtures in our children the spirit of our country; and 
Whereas
 it is a cherished American custom to devote one day each year to acknowledging publicly our great affection, gratitude, and respect for our mothers; and 
Whereas
, in official acknowledgment of these sentiments of our people, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the public observance of that day: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 14, 1961, be observed as Mother's Day; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day. 
I also call upon the people of the United States to observe Mother's Day by display of the flag at their homes or other suitable places, and to manifest through private and public expressions the reverent esteem in which we hold our mothers. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
