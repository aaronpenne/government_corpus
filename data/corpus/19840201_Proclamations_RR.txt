By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The tourism industry is extremely important to the United States, contributing to our employment, economic prosperity, and international trade and understanding. 
Each of us benefits from the effects of tourism. It substantially enhances our personal growth and education. Tourism also promotes intercultural understanding and appreciation of the geography, history and people of the United States. Now that inflation has been reduced and the economy is growing, personal incomes and leisure time will increase more rapidly. Tourism therefore can be expected to play an even greater role in the lives of the American people. 
In recognition of the significance of the tourism industry to the enhancement of international trade, understanding and goodwill, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 168, has designated the week beginning May 27, 1984, as "National Tourism Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 27, 1984, as National Tourism Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 1st day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
