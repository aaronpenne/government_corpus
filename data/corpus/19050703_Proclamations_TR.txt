A Proclamation
 
John Hay, Secretary of State of the United States, died on July 1st. His death, a crushing sorrow to his friends, is to the people of this country a national bereavement; and it is in addition a serious loss to all mankind, for to him it was given to stand as a leader in the effort to better world-conditions by striving to advance the cause of international peace and justice. He entered the public service as the trusted and intimate companion of Abraham Lincoln, and for well-nigh forty-five years he served his country with loyal devotion and high ability in many positions of honor and trust; and finally he crowned his life work by serving as Secretary of State with such farsighted reading of the future and such loyalty to lofty ideals as to confer lasting benefits not only upon our own country but upon all the nations of the earth.
As a suitable expression of national mourning, I direct that the Diplomatic representatives of the United States in all foreign countries display the flags over their embassies and legations at half-mast for ten days; that for a like period the flag of the United States be displayed at half-mast at all forts and military posts and at all naval stations and on all vessels of the United States.
I further order that on the day of the funeral the Executive Departments in the city of Washington be closed and that on all public buildings throughout the United States the national flag be displayed at half-mast.
Done
 at the city of Washington, this third day of July, A.D., 1905, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and twenty-ninth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.

HERBERT H. D. PEIRCE,
 Acting Secretary of State.
