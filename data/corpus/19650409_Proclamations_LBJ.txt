A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the year 1965 will mark the twentieth anniversary of the signing of the United Nations Charter in San Francisco; and 
Whereas
 the year 1965 has been designated by the United Nations General Assembly as International Cooperation Year, and I have so proclaimed it for the United States; and 
Whereas
 our own peace and prosperity is directly interwoven with the peace, prosperity, and development of the rest of mankind; and 
Whereas
 our future is made more secure when we can share with other members of the United Nations the responsibility for keeping the peace and building a better world; and 
Whereas
 the United Nations, despite many difficult problems, is the best organization yet devised in which nations can work together for world peace; for promotion of fundamental human rights, justice, and the rule of law among nations; and for social progress and better standards of living; and 
Whereas
 it is essential in our democratic society to maintain informed public support for United States policies in the United Nations; and 
Whereas
 enlightened public opinion in this regard requires accurate and timely information about the United Nations and its large family of agencies whose activities serve the United States and all other members; and 
Whereas
 the General Assembly of the United Nations has resolved that October twenty-fourth, the date of the coming into force of the United Nations Charter in 1945, should be dedicated each year to making known the purposes, principles, and accomplishments of the United Nations: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, October 24, 1965, as United Nations Day, and urge the citizens of this Nation to observe that day by means of community programs which will contribute to a realistic understanding of the aims, problems, and achievements of the United Nations and its associated organizations. 
I also call upon officials of the Federal and State Governments and upon local officials to encourage citizen groups and agencies of communication-press, radio, television, and motion pictures-to engage in special and appropriate observance of United Nations Day this 
year 
in cooperation with the United Nations Association of the United States of America and other interested organizations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State.
