By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, and in order to eliminate an agency reporting requirement which has proved ineffective and which consumes resources that could be employed in a more effective manner to prevent antitrust violations, Executive Order No. 10936, of April 24, 1961, is hereby revoked.
