A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the armed forces of the United States have steadfastly served as champions of the security of our country; and
Whereas
 the members of the armed forces of the United States are now engaged in tasks which demonstrate to the world our free way of life, our desire to maintain peace with the rest of the world, and our aspiration to insure national security through better international understanding; and
Whereas
, in order to maintain an essential ready reserve of trained military personnel, the armed forces of the United States are placing added emphasis on a reserve-forces program; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that the armed forces of this Nation dedicate a special day each year to the demonstration of their operations and capabilities; and
Whereas
 it is desirable that the people of the United States and of the world be apprised of our unified program of Power for Peace; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that the armed forces invite the public to visit on that day, so far as security requirements permit, posts, camps, stations, bases, vessels, armories, reserve centers, and other facilities:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 19, 1956, as Armed Forces Day; and I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury on behalf of the Coast Guard, to mark that day with appropriate ceremonies, to arrange for demonstrations and displays at armed forces installations, to invite participation by representatives of all religious faiths in such ceremonies in order that the interdependence of our security and the deep and abiding religious faith of Americans may be recognized, and to work hand in hand with civil authorities in arranging other supporting activities.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to provide for the observance of the day in such appropriate manner as will afford an opportunity for the people of the United States to become better acquainted with their armed forces.
And I call upon my fellow citizens not only to display the flag of the United States on Armed Forces Day, in manifestation of their recognition of the sacrifice and devotion to duty of the members of the armed forces, but also to avail themselves of the opportunity to further their knowledge of our defense posture and of the men and women who constitute our real national strength, by attending and participating in the local observances of the day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
