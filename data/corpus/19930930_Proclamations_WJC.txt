A Proclamation
 
As a mark of respect for the memory of General James H. Doolittle, one of our Nation's foremost military heroes, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that on Friday, October 1, 1993, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government, in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff on the same day at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.
