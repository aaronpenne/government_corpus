By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Since its first observance fifty years ago, Pan American Day has served as an annual reminder of the common ideals of the nations of this hemisphere, further strengthening our peoples' bonds. 
Commitment to such common goals among nations is an example for the world. Such cooperation has as its first priority the resolution of differences through peaceful conciliation and arbitration. The Organization of American States has provided a valuable framework for such progress to be made. 
Through increased awareness and mutual cooperation, the Pan American nations strive to promote peace and stability in the region, as well as economic, social and cultural development. Pan American Day commemorates the voluntary cooperation of our countries in achieving solidarity of purpose while maintaining individuality of culture and tradition. 
On this Pan American Day of 1981, the people of the United States extend warm greetings to their neighbors in the Americas, and reaffirm their commitment to the spirit of solidarity, the ideals and purposes of the Inter-American system, and their active support of the Organization of American States. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, April 14, 1981, as Pan American Day, and the week beginning on April 12, 1981, as Pan American Week; and I urge the Governors of the fifty States, and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of the other areas under the flag of the United States of America to honor these observances with appropriate activities and ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
