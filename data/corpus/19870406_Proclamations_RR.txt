By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Heart disease and heart attacks are the primary cause of death among Americans. Scientific research has clearly established elevated blood cholesterol as one of the three major modifiable risk factors for coronary heart disease. Research has also demonstrated the encouraging news that people can reduce their risk of heart disease by lowering high blood cholesterol. 
Having blood cholesterol checked is the only way to know whether we are at high risk or not. The testing of cholesterol level is the first step toward identifying and controlling a serious condition that is a major contributor to America's number one killer. 
More than 20 medical, public health, and voluntary health organizations have joined with the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute to form the National Cholesterol Education Program. These and other organizations have endorsed "Know Your Cholesterol" as an educational theme of this national effort.
The Congress, by Public Law 100-13, has designated the week of April 5 through April 11, 1987, as "Know Your Cholesterol Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of April 5 through April 11, 1987, as Know Your Cholesterol Week. I urge all Americans to become familiar with the dangers of high blood cholesterol and to take steps to determine their cholesterol levels and discuss the implications of their cholesterol measurement at their next visit to their doctor. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
