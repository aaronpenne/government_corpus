A Proclamation
The Red Cross is a symbol of mercy throughout the world. 
It is our first assurance of help in time of disaster. 
It accompanies the soldier on the battlefield, and even into the prison camps of the enemy. 
Our role in the international Red Cross movement is carried on by the American National Red Cross. No group of Americans performs a more humanitarian service, or is more deserving of support, than the 2,000,000 volunteers enrolled in the 3,500 Red Cross Chapters across our nation. 
This year alone, the Red Cross will respond to the needs of the victims of some 12,000 to 14,000 disasters. 
It will supply half of all the blood used by our doctors and hospitals. 
It will save countless lives by teaching more than 50 million Americans the skills of First Aid and Water Safety. 
Above all, it will be a firm and constant source of service and help to the members of our Armed Forces and their families, both here and overseas. 
This faithful and unselfish work of millions of Red Cross volunteers depends upon the unstinting support of all Americans. The Red Cross works for all; it needs the help of all. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March, 1966 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to give this voluntary organization their full support for the benefit of all of our citizens. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
