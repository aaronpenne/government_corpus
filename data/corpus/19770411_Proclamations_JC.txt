By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Nearly 33 million Americans are at least 60 years old, and the number is growing by 500,000 a year. 
Older Americans can provide our youngsters with an awareness of their heritage, and with a sense of family continuity. 
And older Americans can pass on to our children not only the knowledge and wisdom that come with age, but also the values that guided our forebears in building a great republic. 
We must find ways to assure that older citizens will continue to lead useful and productive lives. And we must find ways to use their experience, judgment and ability. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May, 1977, as Older Americans Month. 
I call upon all Federal, State and community agencies, educators, the communications media, the clergy, and concerned organizations and individuals to do all that lies within their power to help assure that our older citizens have an adequate personal income, access to housing facilities responsive to their needs, adequate services such as health care and transportation, fair employment opportunities, and opportunities for continued involvement in our Nation's activities. Let each of us resolve to do all that is possible to guarantee to these Americans that their later years will be rich, secure and filled with the dignity that is, and ought to be, the birthright of all Americans. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
