A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 April 14, 1963 will mark the seventy-third anniversary of the inter-American system established by the American Republics and by them designated as the Organization of American States; and 
Whereas
 the United States of America is, and has been from the beginning, an integral part of this organization of free Republics of the Western Hemisphere, whose collective interdependence maintains and strengthens their individual independence; and _ 
Whereas
 these Republics are now actively allied in an unparalleled cooperative effort to achieve individually and collectively the economic growth and social progress which will open to the citizens of this Hemisphere frontiers of opportunity beyond any yet known to mankind; and 
Whereas
 the United States of America has supported consistently and uninterruptedly in our hemisphere relationships the basic ideal of freedom with order through which the American Republics achieved their independence and on which their progress is firmly based: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, April 14, 1963 as Pan American Day, and the week from April 14 through April 20, 1963, as Pan American Week; and I call upon the Governors of the fifty States of the Union, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the Governors of all other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations. 
In the interest of inter-American friendship and solidarity, I urge all United States citizens and interested organizations to contribute enthusiastically, by words and works, toward making Pan American Day and Pan American Week occasion for rejoicing that our free Republics during the past year have strongly reaffirmed the will for freedom and the determination to stand together in its defense, and a resolute intent to create in this hemisphere, through our Alliance for Progress, an invigorating environment of hope, confidence, and achievement. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eleventh day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
