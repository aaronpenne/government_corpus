A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States by the act approved on March 18, 1959 (73 Stat. 4), accepted, ratified, and confirmed the constitution adopted by a vote of the people of Hawaii in an election held on November 7, 1950, and provided for the admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union on an equal footing with the other States upon compliance with certain procedural requirements specified in that act; and 
Whereas
 it appears from the information before me that a majority of the legal votes cast at an election on June 27, 1959, were in favor of each of the propositions required to be submitted to the people of Hawaii by section 7(b) of the act of March 18, 1959; and 
Whereas
 it further appears from information before me that a general election was held on July 28, 1959, and that the returns of the general election were made and certified as provided in the act of March 18, 1959; and 
Whereas
 the Governor of Hawaii has certified to me the results of the submission to the people of Hawaii of the three propositions set forth in section 7(b) of the act of March 18, 1959, and the results of the general election; and 
Whereas
 I find and announce that the people of Hawaii have duly adopted the propositions required to be submitted to them by the act of March 18, 1959, and have duly elected the officers required to be elected by that act: 
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby declare and proclaim that the procedural requirements imposed by the Congress on the State of Hawaii to entitle that State to admission into the Union have been complied with in all respects and that admission of the State of Hawaii into the Union on an equal footing with the other States of the Union is now accomplished. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington at four p.m. E.D.T. on this twenty-first day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
