By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 3347 of title 5 and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows: 
SECTION 1. During any period when, by reason of absence, disability, or vacancy in office, either the Secretary of the Treasury or his Deputy Secretary is not available to exercise the powers or perform the duties of the office of Secretary, an officer from the Department of the Treasury appointed by the President-by and with the advice and consent of the Senate, in such order as the Secretary of the Treasury may from time to time prescribe-shall act as Secretary until the absence or the disability of the incumbent shall cease, or until a successor is appointed. If no such order of succession is in effect at that time, then such officers shall act as Secretary in the descending order of rank, as established by their offices being listed in sections 5314, 5315 or 5316 of title 5 of the United States Code and, at each level of the Executive Schedule, in the order which they shall have taken the oath as such officers. 
SECTION 2. Executive Order No. 11680 of August 21, 1972, entitled "Designation of Certain Officers to Act as Secretary of the Treasury" is hereby revoked.
