WHEREAS J. Edgar Hoover, Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, will, during the month of January 1965, become subject to compulsory retirement for age under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act, unless exempted therefrom; and
WHEREAS, in my judgment, the public interest requires that Mr. Hoover be exempted from such compulsory retirement:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the Civil Service Retirement Act, 70 Stat. 748 (5 U.S.C. 2255), I hereby exempt J. Edgar Hoover from compulsory retirement for age for an indefinite period of time.
Except as the authority vested in the President by section 5 of the Civil Service Retirement Act is specifically exercised in this Order, nothing contained in this Order shall be deemed to limit or restrict in any manner the exercise of such authority by the Civil Service Commission under authority delegated to the Commission by section 2(c) of Executive Order No. 10530 of May 10, 1954, as amended by Executive Order No. 10682 of October 22, 1956.
