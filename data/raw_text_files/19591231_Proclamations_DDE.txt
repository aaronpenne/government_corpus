A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 one of the greatest heritages of American citizenship is a government of law before which all men stand as equals, and the dedication of our people to freedom under law has made possible the remarkable growth and development of our society in all its aspects; and
Whereas
 respect for justice under law is vital and abiding only when its roots are grounded in our many traditions of religion, ethics, and philosophy with their common teaching concerning law as the foundation of our social order; and
Whereas
 the widest possible understanding of these basic truths will contribute to the Nation's moral and spiritual strength, and a reaffirmation of faith in the rule of law in the daily lives of all Americans will serve to demonstrate to the peoples of the world that this Nation seeks only fairness and Justice in its relations with other nations; and
Whereas
 the observance of Law Day is designed to foster this deeper respect for law and an awareness of its essential place in American life, as well as to encourage the efforts now being made to bring about an extension of law as an instrument of world peace and orderly progress in all international relationships for the future benefit of mankind:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, May 1, 1960, as Law Day in the United States of America.
I urge the people of the United States to observe Law Day with appropriate ceremonies as a public demonstration of their devotion to the rule of law as the keystone of peace and order in our national and international life.
I also urge the members of the legal profession to bring the objectives of Law Day to public attention in all appropriate ways, through religious and educational institutions, by private organizations and public bodies, and through the media of public information.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirty-first day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
