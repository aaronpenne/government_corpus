By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
One hundred and ninety-six years ago, Casimir Pulaski, a Polish patriot in exile, gave his life in the struggle for American independence. 
General Pulaski came to the United States in 1777, when barely 30 years of age, to join George Washington's Revolutionary Army. He served with great distinction at Brandywine and was promoted by the Continental Congress to the rank of Brigadier General. He commanded a cavalry division and later organized an independent corps of cavalry and light infantry which won acclaim as Pulaski's Legion. In October, 1779, during the Battle of Savannah, he was mortally wounded while leading his cavalry unit in a daring charge. 
It is appropriate to commemorate General Pulaski's heroic sacrifice in the cause of freedom. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 11, 1975, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two-hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
