By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and by section 7 (c) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, on June 30, 1954, I issued Proclamation No. 3059 (19 F. R. 4103) modifying item 763 of Part I of Schedule XX (original) annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade so as to provide that not more than 1,500,000 pounds of alsike clover seed described in the said item 763 entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1954, should be dutiable at 2 cents per pound and that any such seed not subject to the rate of 2 cents per pound should be dutiable at 6 cents per pound;
2. 
Whereas
, on July 14, 1954, I directed the United States Tariff Commission to continue its investigation under section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, with regard to alsike clover seed, and to submit to me a supplementary report indicating whether the Commission considered the continuation of the tariff quota referred to in the previous recital beyond June 30, 1955, to be necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry concerned which was reported to me by the Commission on May 21, 1954, to exist by reason of increased imports of such seed;
3. 
Whereas
, on April 28, 1955, the United States Tariff Commission reported to me that as a result of its continued investigation, including a public hearing, it has found that the continuation beyond June 30, 1955 of a modified tariff quota on alsike clover seed is necessary to prevent or remedy the serious injury to the domestic industry concerned;
4. 
Whereas
 section 350 (a) (2) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, authorizes the President to proclaim such modification of existing duties and such additional import restrictions as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into under the said section 350 (a); and
5. 
Whereas
 I find that the further modification of the concession granted in the said General Agreement with respect to alsike clover seed described in the said item 763 to permit the application to such seed of the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed is necessary to prevent serious injury to the domestic industry producing the like or directly competitive product, and that upon such further modification of the said concession it will be appropriate to carry out the said General Agreement to apply to alsike clover seed the duty treatment hereinafter proclaimed:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and by section 7 (c) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended, and in accordance with the provisions of the said General Agreement, do proclaimâ€”
(a) That the provision in the said item 763 with respect to alsike clover seed shall be further modified during the period July 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, both dates inclusive, to read as follows:
(b) That during the period July 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, both dates inclusive, alsike clover seed described in the said item 763, as modified by paragraph (a) above, shall be subject to the rates of duty specified in the said item 763 as so modified.
Proclamation No. 2761A 2 of December 16, 1947, as amended and supplemented, is modified accordingly during the period July 1, 1955 to June 30, 1957, both dates inclusive.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 29th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
