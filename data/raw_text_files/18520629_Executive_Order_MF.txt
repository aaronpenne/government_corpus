SIR:* The tolling bells announce the death of the Hon. Henry Clay. Though this event has been long anticipated, yet the painful bereavement could never be fully realized. I am sure all hearts are too sad at this moment to attend to business, and I therefore respectfully suggest that your Department be closed for the remainder of the day.
I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,
MILLARD FILLMORE.
 *Addressed to the heads of the several Executive Departments.
