Whereas,
 the government of the United States of America has agreed with the Government of the United States of Brazil that said trade agreement referred to in the 1st recital of this proclamation, except the right of termination thereof on six months' notice, shall be inoperative for such time as the United States of America and the United States of Brazil are both contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 30, 1947, as defined in article XXXII thereof;
Whereas,
 as indicated in the 7th recital of Proclamation 2761A of December 16, 1947, the Government of the United States of America is applying said general agreement provisionally on and after January 1, 1948 with the result that the United States of America is such a contracting party;

Now, Therefore, be it known that I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority conferred by the said section 350(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, do hereby proclaim that said proclamation of December 2, 1935 shall not be in effect after July 30, 1948 except insofar as it relates to the termination on six months' notice of said trade agreement of February 2, 1935 including said notes exchanged on April 17, 1935.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
