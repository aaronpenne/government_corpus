UNITED STATES CIVIL SERVICE COMMISSION,
 Washington, D.C., October 17, 1888.
 
The PRESIDENT.
SIR: This Commission has been informed by the Treasury Department that an additional teller has been authorized to be appointed at the custom-house in the city of New York, and that his immediate employment is desired.
This position is not one excepted from examination by Customs Rule II, clause 5, but the collector thinks, in view of its fiduciary character, that it ought to be filled by noncompetitive instead of by competitive examination, and in this view the Commission concurs. It is therefore respectfully recommended that a noncompetitive examination for the purpose be authorized under subdivision (e) of clause 2 of General Rule III, Revised Civil-Service Rules.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
CHAS. LYMAN,
 Commissioner, in Charge
 .
Approved, October 17, 1888.
