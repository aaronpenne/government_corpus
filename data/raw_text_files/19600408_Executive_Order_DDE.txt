By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the Inter-American Development Bank under the authority of an act of Congress approved August 7, 1959 (73 Stat. 299), I hereby designate the Inter-American Development Bank as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.
The designation of the Inter-American Development Bank as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act shall not be deemed to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and Immunities which that organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.
