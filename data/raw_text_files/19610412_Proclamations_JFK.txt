A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 we as a people enjoy the blessings of a free democratic society in a world threatened by the forces of totalitarianism; and 
Whereas
 steadfast devotion to our country and our Constitution is indispensable to the preservation of our freedom and liberty; and 
Whereas
 it is most appropriate that a special day be set aside each year for the affirmative expression of our loyalty to the United States of America and for the recognition of our heritage of freedom; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe Monday, May 1, 1961, as Loyalty Day, in schools and other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of our people may join in the reaffirmation of their loyalty to the United States of America. 
I also call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK,
