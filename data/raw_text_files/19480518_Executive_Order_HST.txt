WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between the American Telephone and Telegraph Company (Long Lines Division) and certain of its employees represented by the American Union of Telephone Workers (CIO); and
WHEREAS in my opinion such dispute threatens to result in a strike or lock-out affecting a substantial part of the communications industry, an industry engaged in transmission or communication among the several States or with foreign nations, which strike or lock-out, if permitted to occur, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (Public Law 101, 80th Congress), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before June 8, 1948.
Upon the submission if its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
