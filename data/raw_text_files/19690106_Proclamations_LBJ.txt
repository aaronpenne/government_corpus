By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
WHEREAS, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas,
 in accordance with section 102(3) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963, proclaimed the additional import restrictions set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions on certain dairy products set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 3548 have been amended by Proclamation No. 3558 of October 5, 1963, Proclamation No. 3562 of November 26, 1963, Proclamation No. 3597 of July 7, 1964, section 88 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 950), Proclamation No. 3709 of March 31, 1966, Proclamation No. 3790 of June 30, 1967, Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967, Proclamation No. 3856 of June 10, 1968, and Proclamation No. 3870 of September 24, 1968; and
Whereas,
 pursuant to said section 22, the Secretary of Agriculture advised me there was reason to believe that the articles, for which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed, continued in effect, or modified, are being imported, and are practically certain to be imported, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the price support programs now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas,
 under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture further determined and reported to me with respect to certain of these articles that a condition existed which required emergency treatment, and as a result, Presidential Proclamations 3856 and 3870 were issued placing import restrictions upon certain of these articles without awaiting the recommendations of the Tariff Commission, such restrictions to continue in effect pending the report and recommendations of the Tariff Commission and action thereon by the President; and
Whereas,
 in compliance with my request the Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, with respect to this matter and has reported to me the findings and recommendations of the Commissioners voting in connection therewith; and
Whereas
 the findings and recommendations unanimously agreed upon by one-half of the number of Commissioners voting are considered by me pursuant to section 201 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1953 (19 U.S.C. 1330(d)) as the findings and recommendations of the Commission; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that the articles for which import restrictions are hereinafter proclaimed, continued in effect or modified, are being imported and are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the price support programs now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that the imposition of the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed or continued in effect is necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such articles will not render or tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the price support programs now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat, or reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk and butterfat; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that changed circumstances require the modification, as hereinafter proclaimed, of provisions applicable to the import restrictions on natural Cheddar cheese, as set forth in subdivision (i) of headnote 3 (a) in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States, and in the import restrictions set forth as items 950.12 and 950.13 (hereinafter redesignated as items 950.22 and 950.23) in part 3 of such Appendix in order to carry out the purposes of said section 22; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that for the purpose of the first proviso of section 22(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the representative period for imports of articles, subject to import quotas hereinafter provided for in items 950.10A and 950.15 in part 3 of the Appendix of the Tariff Schedules of the United States, is the calendar years 1965 through 1967, and that the representative periods for imports of other articles for which quotas are hereinafter continued in effect or modified are the same as set forth for such articles in previous applicable proclamations;
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that:
