A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross has served the American people and the cause of human welfare for more than seventy-five years; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross, through its blood program, benefits thousands in our hospitals, and, through additional programs of first aid, water safety, and home nursing, provides the people of our communities, including children of school age, with essential training in health, safety, and citizenship; and
Whereas
, in addition to its aid to civilians, the Red Cross also serves our armed forces at home and overseas; and
Whereas
 the violent disasters of recent years, in which volunteers of the Red Cross heroically helped stricken communities and families, have dangerously reduced the organization's material resources:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1958 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to honor the Red Cross during that month and to support its magnificent services throughout the year.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
