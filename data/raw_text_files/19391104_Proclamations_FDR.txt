By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 1 of the joint resolution of Congress approved November 4, 1939, provides in part as follows:
"That whenever the President, or the Congress by concurrent resolution, shall find that there exists a state of war between foreign states, and that it is necessary to promote the security or preserve the peace of the United States or to protect the lives of citizens of the United States, the President shall issue a proclamation naming the States involved; and he shall, from time to time, by proclamation, name other States as and when they may become involved in war."
And Whereas
 it is further provided by section 13 of the said joint resolution that
"The President may, from time to time, promulgate such rules and regulations, not inconsistent with law as may be necessary and proper to carry out any of the provisions of this joint resolution; and he may exercise any power or authority conferred on him by this joint resolution through such officer or officers, or agency or agencies, as he shall direct."
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority conferred on me by the said joint resolution, do hereby proclaim that a state of war unhappily exists between Germany and France; Poland; and the United Kingdom, India, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and the Union of South Africa, and that it is necessary to promote the security and preserve the peace of the United States and to protect the lives of citizens of the United States.
And I do hereby
 enjoin upon all officers of the United States, charged with the execution of the laws thereof, the utmost diligence in preventing violations of the said joint resolution and in bringing to trial and punishment any offenders against the same.
And I do hereby
 delegate to the Secretary of State the power to exercise any power or authority conferred on me by the said joint resolution, as made effective by this my proclamation issued thereunder, which is not specifically delegated by Executive order to some other officer or agency of this Government, and the power to promulgate such rules and regulations not inconsistent with law as may be necessary and proper to carry out any of its provisions.
And I do hereby
 revoke my proclamations nos. 2349, 2354 and 2360 issued on September 5, 8, and 10, 1939, respectively, in regard to the export of arms, ammunition, and implements of war to France; Germany; Poland; and the United Kingdom, India, Australia, and New Zealand; to the Union of South Africa; and to Canada.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
