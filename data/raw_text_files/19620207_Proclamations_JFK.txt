A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 accidental poisoning consistently takes a substantial toll of lives each year, especially among very young children; and 
Whereas
 virtually all deaths attributable to this cause could be prevented; and 
Whereas
 prevention of accidental poisoning can best be promoted through a vigorous program designed to alert parents and others responsible for protection of children against this hazard; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), the Congress has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 18, 1962, as National Poison Prevention Week. 
I direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, and I invite State and local governments and organizations interested in child safety, to participate actively in programs intended to promote better protection against accidental poisonings. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
