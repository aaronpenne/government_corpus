Whereas
 the fitness of the youth of America is essential to the present and future strength of our Nation; and 
Whereas
 in connection with the challenges that our Nation must meet in the days and years ahead, it is imperative that our young people be aware of their obligation to themselves, their families, and to their country to maintain their vigor and fitness; and 
Whereas

Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning April 30, 1961, as National Youth Fitness Week. 
I request officials of the Government, and I urge parents, young people, and interested national and local organizations, to use all appropriate means now and during that week to promote programs and activities demonstrating the importance of youth fitness to the end that we may assure the continuing strength and well-being of our people. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
