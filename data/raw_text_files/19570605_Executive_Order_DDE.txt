NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution, and as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Except as the Congress may otherwise provide by law with respect to the government of the Ryukyu Islands, all administrative, legislative, and jurisdictional powers reposed in the United States by Article 3 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan shall be exercised in accordance with this order.
SEC. 2. The said powers shall be exercised by the Secretary of Defense, subject to the direction and control of the President of the United States. In the exercise of this authority the Secretary of Defense shall encourage the development of an effective and responsible Ryukyuan government, based on democratic principles and supported by a sound financial structure, shall make every effort to improve the welfare and well-being of the inhabitants of the Ryukyu Islands, and shall continue to promote the economic and cultural advancement of the inhabitants. The Secretary of Defense may delegate any function vested in him by this order to such officials or organizational entities of the Department of Defense as he may designate.
SEC. 3. The Secretary of State shall be responsible for the conduct of relations with foreign countries and international organizations with respect to the Ryukyu Islands.
SEC. 4. There is established, under the jurisdiction of the Secretary of Defense, a civil administration of the Ryukyu Islands, the head of which shall be known as the High Commissioner of the Ryukyu Islands (hereinafter referred to as the "High Commissioner"). The High Commissioner (a) shall be designated by the Secretary of Defense, after consultation with the Secretary of State and with the approval of the President, from among the active duty members of the armed forces of the United States, (b) shall have the powers and perform the duties assigned to him by the terms of this order, (c) may delegate any function vested in him to such officials of the civil administration as he may designate, and (d) shall carry out any powers or duties delegated or assigned to him by the Secretary of Defense pursuant to this order.
SEC. 5. There is hereby continued, subject to the provisions of this order, the now existing Ryukyuan central government (hereinafter referred to as the Government of the Ryukyu Islands).
SEC. 6. The legislative power of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands, except as otherwise provided in this order, shall be vested in a legislative body whose members are directly elected by the people of the islands. The legislature shall consist of a single house of 29 members who shall be elected biennially in even numbered years from single representative districts.
SEC. 7. The legislative body shall exercise legislative powers which extend only to all subjects of legislation of domestic application. The legislative body shall determine the procedures for judging the selection and qualification of its own members and shall choose therefrom its officers and determine its rules and procedures. Local legislative bodies, the members of which shall be elected by the inhabitants of the respective municipalities in accordance with procedures established by the legislative body of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands, shall be given and shall exercise appropriate municipal legislative powers. The High Commissioner shall report to the Secretary of Defense all laws enacted by the legislative body of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands and the said Secretary shall report the same to the Congress of the United States.
Sac. 8. The executive power of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands shall be vested in a Chief Executive who shall be a Ryukyuan, appointed by the High Commissioner after consultation with representatives of the legislative body. The Chief Executive shall have general supervision and control of all executive agencies and instrumentalities of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands and shall faithfully execute the laws and ordinances applicable to the Ryukyu Islands. The head of each municipal government shall be elected by the people of the respective municipality in accordance with procedures established by the legislative body of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands.
SEC. 9. Every bill passed by the legislative body shall, before it becomes law, be presented to the Chief Executive. If the Chief Executive approves a bill he shall sign it, but if not he shall return it, with his objections, to the legislative body within fifteen days after it shall have been presented to him. If a bill is not returned within the specified fifteen day period, it shall become law in like manner as if it had been approved by the Chief Executive, unless the legislative body by adjournment prevents its return, in which case it shall be law if approved by the Chief Executive within forty-five days after it shall have been presented to him; otherwise it shall not be law. When a bill is returned to the legislative body with objections by the Chief Executive, the legislative body may proceed to reconsider it. If, after such reconsideration two thirds of the legislative body pass it, it shall be sent to the High Commissioner. If the High Commissioner approves it, he shall sign it. If he does not approve it, he shall return it to the legislative body so stating, and it shall not be law. If the High Commissioner neither approves nor disapproves the bill within forty-five days from the date of transmittal to him by the legislative body, it shall become law in like manner as if he had signed it. If any bill approved by the legislative body contains several items of appropriation of money, the Chief Executive may object to one or more of such items or any part or parts, portion or portions thereof, while approving the other items, or parts or portions of the bill. In such case, the Chief Executive shall append to the bill, at the time of signing it, a statement of the items, or parts or portions thereof, objected to, and the items, or parts or portions thereof, so objected to shall not take effect. Should the legislative body seek to override such objections of the Chief Executive, the procedures set forth above will apply. In computing any period of days for the foregoing purposes, Sundays and legal holidays shall be excluded.
SEC. 10. Judicial powers in the Ryukyu Islands shall be exercised as follows:
(a) A system of courts, including the civil and criminal courts of original jurisdiction and appellate tribunals, shall be maintained by the Government of the Ryukyu Islands. These courts shall exercise jurisdiction as follows:

In this event, such cases instituted in a court of the Government of the Ryukyu Islands shall be transferred to the appropriate civil administration court by order of the High Commissioner at any time in the proceedings, including final appellate process, prior to the entering of final decree, order or judgment. Cases so transferred may be subject to trial de novo in the discretion of the court of the civil administration.

Cases so transferred may be subject to trial de novo in the discretion of the court of the civil administration.
(c) Criminal jurisdiction over persons subject to trial by courts-martial under the Uniform Code of Military Justice (10 U.S.C. 801 et seq.) will be exercised by courts other than courts-martial only when the military commander concerned determines not to exercise military jurisdiction under the Uniform Code of Military Justice and specifically indicates to the High Commissioner his approval of referring the case to another court.

The highest appellate court of the civil administration shall have power to affirm, modify, set aside or reverse the judgment, order or decree reviewed or to remand the case with such directions for a new trial or for entry of judgment as may be just. In a criminal case, the appellate court may set aside the judgment of conviction, or may commute, reduce (but not increase) or suspend the execution of sentence.
