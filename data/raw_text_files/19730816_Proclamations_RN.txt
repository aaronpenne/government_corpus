By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
When we think of our American judicial system we think most often of the judges, lawyers, court reporters, juries, clients, law enforcement officers and others who are a part of the courtroom scene. But often we fail to give proper recognition to the legal secretaries who make it possible for our judicial system to function effectively.
Highly trained and highly skilled legal secretaries make an indispensable contribution to the administration of justice in America. Because they work behind the scenes, however, many of these individuals have little opportunity for exposure to actual courtroom proceedings. Many believe that courtroom exposure of this type would enrich their understanding of their work.
To emphasize the desirability of courtroom experience for legal secretaries, the Congress has enacted House Joint Resolution 466, the 93rd Congress, which authorizes and requests the President to proclaim the second full week in October of this year as National Legal Secretaries' Court Observance Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 14, 1973, as National Legal Secretaries' Court Observance Week. I call upon the people of the United States, particularly the legal community, to observe that week with appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
