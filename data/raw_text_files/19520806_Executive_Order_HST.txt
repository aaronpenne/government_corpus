By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of August 2, 1946, ch. 744, 60 Stat. 806, it is ordered that section 21 of Executive Order No. 9805 of November 25, 1946, prescribing regulations governing payment of travel and transportation expenses of civilian officers and employees of the United States when transferred from one official station to another for permanent duty, be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:
"SEC. 21. Means of shipment. Transportation services, including allowances specified in sections 18 and 19 hereof, may be procured by the agency concerned from any available common carrier: Provided, however, that an employee may elect to have his effects moved by some means other than the means selected by the Government on the condition that he shall pay the amount, if any, by which the charges for the means of transportation selected by him exceed the charges for the means of transportation selected by the Government."
