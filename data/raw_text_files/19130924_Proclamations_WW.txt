A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the lands described in the Act of Congress approved April twenty-first, nineteen hundred and six (thirty-fourth Statutes at Large, one twenty-four), were, by Proclamation of the President issued August twelfth, nineteen hundred and seven, and in the manner therein provided, restored to settlement, entry and disposition under the general provisions of the homestead laws and of the Act of April twenty-first, nineteen hundred and six, on October twenty-first, nineteen hundred and seven, and have been subject to disposition under the general provisions of the homestead laws and the Act of April twenty-first, nineteen hundred and six, since December twentieth, nineteen hundred and seven; and 
Whereas,
 a portion of said lands remained undisposed of; and 
Whereas,
 in my judgment, no more of said lands can be disposed of at the appraised value thereof, and under the provisions of said Act of April twenty-first, nineteen hundred and six, I now deem it to the best interest of all concerned to sell said undisposed of lands in the manner hereinafter directed: 
Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
 President of the United States of America, do, in the exercise of the authority conferred on me by said Act of Congress, prescribe and proclaim that all of said lands now remaining undisposed of shall be offered for sale to the highest bidders for cash at not less than one dollar per acre, at public outcry, at the City of Pierre, in the State of South Dakota, under the supervision of James W. Witten, Superintendent of the Opening and Sale of Indian Reservations, beginning at ten o'clock A.M., on Monday, November third, nineteen hundred and thirteen, and continuing thereafter from day to day, Sundays excepted, as long as may be necessary to the offering of all of said lands, and the Secretary of the Interior is hereby authorized to issue such regulations as he may deem necessary to carry this proclamation into effect, and to cause patents to issue to the purchasers at said sale of said lands upon the full payment by such purchasers of the price thereof. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 24th day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-eighth. 
WOODROW WILSON 
By the President: 
W. J. BRYAN 
Secretary of State.
