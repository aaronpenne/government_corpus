By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
More than anything else, we seek the blessing of good health for our children. We hope for the sound minds in sound bodies that lead to lives of strength and achievement. 
Through the resources of a health care system second to none, this Nation strives to protect all of our children from preventable diseases, to encourage behavior that fosters good health, and to treat their episodic illnesses. 
Unfortunately, some children are burdened with disabilities and chronic illnesses and need long-term healing and care. Their ability to thrive and to contribute to society depends on their receiving the kinds of treatment and health care that are available in this country as in few other places on earth. 
Our task on this Child Health Day, 1983, is to fuse our efforts as parents, volunteers, health professionals, and educators to help all children—particularly those with special health needs—take advantage of opportunities that enable them to heal, to grow, and to achieve everything of which they are capable. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, as amended (36 U.S.C. 143), do hereby proclaim Monday, October 3, 1983, as Child Health Day, 1983. 
I urge all Americans to join me in encouraging good health habits and attitudes in our children and invite all citizens and all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to unite on Child Health Day with appropriate observances and activities directed toward establishing such practices in the youth of our country.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 8th day of Aug., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
