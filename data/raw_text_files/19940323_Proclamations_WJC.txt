By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
America's success in the years to come requires a national commitment to providing excellence in education. Our ability to seize the opportunities before us depends on the strength of our scholarship. We must build an educational system that offers our country's vast promise to every citizen. Only when we know that all of our students are receiving the best care and training possible can we say that we are prepared for the challenges of the future.
New innovations in teaching methods and curricula, combined with traditional lessons of ethics and morality, afford students a comprehensive education that will serve them well their entire lives. By sharing our experiences and our beliefs with the next generation of Americans, we can prepare our Nation for the awesome responsibilities and opportunities that lie ahead.
Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the leader of the Lubavitch movement, has contributed a great deal to this important endeavor, advancing the ideals of sharing and education over the course of his long and rich life. As Rabbi Schneerson celebrates his 92nd birthday, it is fitting and appropriate that the people of the United States honor his gifts to education and rededicate themselves to the teaching of ethics and morality.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim March 23, 1994, as Education and Sharing Day, U.S.A. I call upon the people of the United States, Government officials, educators, and volunteers to observe the day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
