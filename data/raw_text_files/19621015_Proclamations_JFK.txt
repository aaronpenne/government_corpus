A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by an Act approved September 2, 1958 (72 Stat. 1698), established a board known as the Trustees of the National Cultural Center to plan, create, and operate a National Cultural Center in the Nation's Capital; and 
Whereas
 the National Cultural Center will provide facilities for the presentation of classical and contemporary music, drama, opera, dance, poetry, and other performing arts; and 
Whereas
 a nationwide fund-raising campaign will give the American people an opportunity to demonstrate their support of the creation of the National Cultural Center and also their support of cultural activities in their own communities; and 
Whereas
 this fund-raising program will be highlighted on November 29, 1962 with a nationwide, closed-circuit telecast entitled "An American Pageant of the Arts," designed to display the contributions of each of the Nation's regions to our national cultural heritage; and 
Whereas
 communities participating in this telecast will retain one-half of the proceeds to support local cultural activities; and 
Whereas
 both Mrs. Kennedy and Mrs. Eisenhower now serve as Honorary Chairmen of the National Cultural Center and a number of citizens prominent in government, business, labor, and the arts are members of its Board of Trustees; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 15, 1962, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period from November 26, 1962, through December 2, 1962, as National Cultural Center Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,

I also call upon the Governors of the States, other State officials, the mayors and city managers, and the various civic, fraternal, and patriotic organizations to join in assuring a successful fund-raising campaign for the National Cultural Center. 
In Witness Whereof,
