WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 9047 of January 30, 1942, certain officers and employees in the executive branch of the Government were exempted from automatic separation from the service under the provisions of the Civil Service Retirement Act of May 29, 1930, as amended, for an indefinite period of time not extending beyond the duration of their appointment or term of service; and
WHEREAS, in my judgment, the public interest no longer requires the exemption of any of such officer or employee from automatic separation from the service:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 204 of the act of June 30, 1932, 47 Stat. 382, 404, and as President of the United States, it is ordered that the said Executive Order No. 9047 be, and it is hereby, revoked.
This order shall become effective at the close of business on March 31, 1954.
