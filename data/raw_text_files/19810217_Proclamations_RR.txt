By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Emergency Building Temperature Restrictions were first implemented on July 16, 1979, by Proclamation No. 4667. They were twice extended, first by Proclamation No. 4750 and second by Proclamation No. 4813. Those restrictions set forth in Energy Conservation Contingency Plan No. 2 (44 FR 12911, March 8, 1979) are effective until October 16, 1981, unless earlier rescinded. 
Although restrictions on building temperatures may result in reduced consumption of fuel, I have concluded that the regulatory scheme designed to accomplish that objective imposes an excessive regulatory burden and that voluntary restraint and market incentives will achieve substantially the same benefit without the regulatory cost. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Section 201(a) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6261(a)), do hereby proclaim that: 
Section 1. The Energy Building Temperature Restrictions as provided for in Energy Conservation Contingency Plan No. 2 (44 FR 12911, March 8, 1979) are no longer required. Therefore, the effectiveness of that Plan as provided for in Proclamation No. 4813 is hereby rescinded.
Sec. 2. Proclamation No. 4813 is revoked.
Sec. 3. The Secretary of Energy shall take such action as may be necessary to ensure the implementation of this Proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
