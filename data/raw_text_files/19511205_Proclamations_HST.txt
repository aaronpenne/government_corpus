A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the General Assembly of the United Nations proclaimed the Universal Declaration of Human Rights on December 10, 1948, as a common standard of achievement, and has invited Member States to celebrate the anniversary of that event as part of a common effort to bring the Declaration to the attention of all peoples and all nations; and
Whereas
 the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization has likewise urged the observance of December 10 as Human Rights Day for this purpose; and
Whereas
 the fundamental rights and freedoms guaranteed in the Constitution of the United States and in the Constitutions of our several States have been a protection to our people and a source of strength to our Government throughout our history, and our citizens have many times demonstrated their concern for the protection of these rights and freedoms for all peoples:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, having in 1949 designated each December 10 as United Nations Human Rights Day, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to celebrate that day in 1951 by public reading of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and by other ceremonies designed to enlarge our understanding of its provisions. In so doing, we will join with the citizens of other countries in a common effort to strengthen the forces of freedom, justice, and peace in the world through promoting the universal achievement of the fundamental human rights and freedoms set forth in the Declaration.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
