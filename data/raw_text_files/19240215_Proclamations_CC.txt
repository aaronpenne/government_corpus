A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it is essential to the continued comfort, welfare, and prosperity of the people of the United States that abundant forests, widely distributed and maintained in a condition of high productiveness, be forever wisely conserved as one of our greatest natural resources; and Whereas, because of our constantly increasing need for wood and other forest products, together with our past failure to provide for reforestation, we are drawing upon our supplies of timber four times as fast as they are renewed through growth; and
Whereas,
 the most formidable agency of forest destruction and prevention of reforestation is fire and, of the fires which annually devastate vast areas, four-fifths are ascribed in origin to human agencies and virtually all may be controlled and made innocuous through prudence, care, and vigilance;
Therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States, do urge upon the Governors of the various States to designate and set apart the week of April 21-27, 1924 as Forest Protection Week, and, wherever practicable and not in conflict with State law or accepted customs, to celebrate Arbor Day within that week. I also urge all citizens, either in association or as individuals, all schools, and the press of the land to give common thought to the protection of our forests from fire, to the end that, in the future as in the past, these forests may supply us with wood, protect the purity of our streams, and otherwise serve the people of the United States.
In witness whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 15th day of February, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-eighth.
CALVIN COOLIDGE
By the President:
CHARLES E. HUGHES, 
Secretary of State
