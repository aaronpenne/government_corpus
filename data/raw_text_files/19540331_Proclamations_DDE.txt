By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and as amended by section 3 of the act of July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261, and section 8 (b) of the act of June 16, 1951, 65 Stat. 72 (7 U. S. C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me there was reason to believe that rye, rye flour, and rye meal are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to rye pursuant to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken;
Whereas
, on December 9, 1953, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter;
Whereas
 the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith;
Whereas
, on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that rye, rye flour, and rye meal, in the aggregate, are being and are practically certain to continue to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to interfere materially with and to tend to render ineffective the said price-support program with respect to rye, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of rye, rye flour, and rye meal will not render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said price-support program:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that
(1) the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in the period beginning on the date of this proclamation and ending at the close of June 30, 1954, shall not exceed 31,000,000 pounds, of which not more than 2,500 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal; and
(2) the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1954, shall not exceed 186,000,000 pounds, of which not more than 15,000 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal, which permissible total quantities I find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 per centum of the total quantity of such rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period July 1, 1950 to June 30, 1953, inclusive.
The provisions of this proclamation shall not apply to certified or registered seed rye for use for seeding and crop-improvement purposes, in bags tagged and sealed by an officially recognized seed-certifying agency of the country of production, if
(a) the individual shipment amounts to 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) or less, or
(b) the individual shipment amounts to more than 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) and the written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture or his designated representative is presented at the time of entry, or bond is furnished in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Customs in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise as set forth in the entry, plus the estimated duty as determined at the time of entry, conditioned upon the production of such written approval within six months from the date of entry.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 31st day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
