A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day provides us with an occasion for dedicating ourselves anew to the task of promoting the spiritual, emotional, and physical wellbeing of children; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we foster the health and welfare of our children in order that they may grow into responsible citizens and may contribute to the peace and productivity of the world; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day is an appropriate time for the citizens of the United States to observe also a Universal Children's Day, and to salute the work which the United Nations Children's Fund, the World Health Organization, and the Food and Agriculture Organization are doing, through the United Nations, to build better health for children:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, the first day of May 1956, as Child Health Day, and I invite all citizens to unite in observances that will emphasize the importance of abundant health for all children.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
