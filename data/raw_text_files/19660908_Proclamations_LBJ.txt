A Proclamation
Whereas
 the United States and Canada on January 16, 1965, entered into an Agreement Concerning Automotive Products, which provides that Canada shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of certain automotive products of the United States and that, after enactment of implementing legislation, the United States shall accord duty-free treatment to certain automotive products of Canada retroactively to the earliest date administratively possible following the date on which the agreement has been implemented by Canada (art. II, 89th Cong., 1st sess., H. Rep. 537, 38);
Whereas
 the agreement of January 16, 1965, was implemented by Canada through the granting of the requisite duty-free treatment to United States products on January 18, 1965;
Whereas
 titles II and IV of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 have been enacted to provide for modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) to implement the agreement of January 16, 1965, such modifications to enter into force in the manner proclaimed by the President (79 Stat. 1016);
Whereas
 sections 201 and 203 of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 authorize the President to proclaim such modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States as will provide for the duty-free treatment of Canadian articles which are original motor- vehicle equipment either if the modifications of such articles are set forth in title IV of that Act or if the President subsequently determines that the importation of the articles is actually or potentially of commercial significance and that such duty-free treatment is required by the agreement, such proclamation to provide for retroactive effect for such duty-free treatment as of the earliest date after January 17, 1965, which the President determines to be practicable;
Whereas,
 by Proclamation No. 3682 of October 21, 1965 (30 F.R. 13683), the President pursuant to sections 201 and 203 proclaimed the modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States provided for in title IV of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965; and
Whereas
 I determine (a) under subsection (b) of section 201 that the importation of the Canadian articles which are original motor-vehicle equipment and which are dutiable under TSUS items 688.04, 688.06, and 688.15 is actually or potentially of commercial significance and that duty-free treatment of such Canadian articles is required to carry out the agreement of January 16, 1965, and (b) under section 203 that the earliest date, after January 17, 1965, as of which it is practicable to give retroactive effect to this proclamation is January 18, 1965:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, particularly sections 201 (b) and 203 of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965, do proclaim that the Tariff Schedules of the United States are modified by inserting in proper numerical sequence new items 688.05, 688.07, and 688.16, each such item having the article description "If Canadian article and original motor-vehicle equipment (sec headnote 2, part 6B, schedule 6) " subordinate to the immediately preceding article description and having "Free" in rate of duty column numbered 1. Such modifications shall enter into force on the day following the date of this proclamation and shall be effective with respect to articles which are or have been entered for consumption, or for warehouse, on or after January 18, 1965.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
