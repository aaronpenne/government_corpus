By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
We can all be grateful for the significant contributions to our economy made by farmers and others who raise dairy goats and market dairy goat products. American farmers currently raise roughly 250,000 of these hardy animals, which can thrive even in harsh areas and have a long association with our country. Columbus and Cook and other famed explorers carried dairy goats aboard their ships for milk and meat, and pioneers and settlers transported them to every part of our land. 
Dairy goat products are increasingly popular as items for export and for domestic use. The number of producers of goat cheese, or Chevre, is rising. An extraordinary variety of American-made goat cheeses is available, as are goat milk, ice cream, and yogurt. 
In recognition of the value of dairy goats, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 17, has designated the period beginning the second Saturday and ending the third Saturday of June 1987 as "National Dairy Goat Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in its observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period beginning the second Saturday and ending the third Saturday of June 1987 as National Dairy Goat Awareness Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh. 
RONALD REAGAN
