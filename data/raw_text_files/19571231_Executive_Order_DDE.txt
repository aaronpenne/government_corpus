1. The Secretary of State, or his designee, is hereby designated and empowered, without the approval, ratification, or other action of the President, to make on behalf of the Government of the United States of America the decision required by Article 11 of the Treaty of Peace with Japan in those cases in which the Government of Japan has submitted recommendations for reduction of sentence or parole with respect to sentences imposed on Japanese war criminals by tribunals established by the Government of the United States or by the International Military Tribunal for the Far East.
2. In exercising the authority vested in him by paragraph 1 hereof, the Secretary of State, in general, shall accept the recommendations of the Government of Japan if they are accompanied by findings made by a responsible non-political board, and if he is satisfied that the board has considered all the pertinent matters in each case under consideration, including the trial record, in arriving at its conclusion.
3. Executive Order No. 10393 of September 4, 1952, establishing the Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals, and Executive Order No. 10613 of May 16, 1955, amending that order, are hereby revoked; and the Clemency and Parole Board for War Criminals is hereby abolished.
