A Proclamation
The abundant life and well-being of millions of Americans are directly related to the bounty of natural resources with which this Nation has been so generously endowed. 
The depths of our American continent have yielded up great treasures of mineral resources, and enormous industries have developed to guarantee a maximum of public benefit from this mineral wealth. 
It has been one hundred and fifty years since the first gas company was founded in Baltimore, Maryland, on June 13, 1816. Since that early beginning this dynamic industry has become the sixth largest industry in the United States. It has developed an intricate web of underground pipelines extending three quarters of a million miles and delivering the heat, light, and power benefits of the American gas industry to its thirty-six and a half million customers. 
To call public attention to the contributions which the gas industry has made toward the health and well-being of our people, the Eighty-ninth Congress by Senate Joint Resolution 160, has designated the period beginning June 13 and ending June 19, 1966, as Gas Industry Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, invite the governments of States and communities and all citizens to join during Gas Industry Week in recognition of the contributions of the American gas industry to the security, health, and well-being of our Nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fifteenth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
