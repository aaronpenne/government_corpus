A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski crossed the Atlantic to fight in the cause of freedom and gave his life for that cause on October 11, 1779, as a result of wounds received while leading the Pulaski Legion in a gallant cavalry charge at the siege of Savannah; and
Whereas
 the story of this Polish patriot's supreme contribution to our independence is a treasured chapter in the annals of a grateful Nation; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we should honor the memory of this distinguished soldier, who attained the rank of Brigadier General in the American Revolutionary Army, on the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of his heroic death:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1954, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I invite the people of our country to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day in tribute to General Casimir Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 27th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
WALTER B. SMITH,
Acting Secretary of State
