By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U. S. C. 1351), the President, on October 30, 1947, entered into a trade agreement with foreign countries, which consists of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the related Protocol of Provisional Application thereof, together with the Final Act Adopted at the Conclusion of the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment (61 Stat. (Parts 5 and 6) A 7, A 11, and A 2051), and, by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. (Part 2) 1103), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out that agreement on and after January 1, 1948;
2. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the said authority, the President, on April 21, 1951, entered into a trade agreement consisting of the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, including the annexes thereto (3 UST (Part 1) 588), and, by Proclamation No. 2929 of June 2, 1951 (3 CFR, 1951 Supp., p. 27), proclaimed such modification of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out that agreement on and after June 6, 1951, which proclamation has been supplemented by several notifications of the President to the Secretary of the Treasury, including a notification dated June 2, 1951;
3. 
Whereas
 the second item 394 in Part I of Schedule XX annexed to the agreement referred to in the first recital of this proclamation (61 Stat. (Part 5) A 1219) reads as follows:
4. 
Whereas
 item 391, the first item 392, item 393, and item 394 in Part I of Schedule XX annexed to the trade agreement referred to in the second recital of this proclamation (3 UST (Part 1) 1167), read, respectively, as follows:
5. 
Whereas
, in accordance with Articles II and XI of the said General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States customs treatment reflecting the concessions granted in the said trade agreements with respect to the articles described in the items reproduced in the third and fourth recitals of this proclamation has been the application of the respective rates of duty specified in such items, without quantitative limitation;
6. 
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its Investigation No. 65 under section 7 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951, as amended (19 U. S. C. 1364), as a result of which the Commission has found that the articles described in the said items (except Babbitt metal, solder, and zinc dust) are, as a result in part of the customs treatment specified in the fifth recital of this proclamation, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities, both actual and relative, as to cause serious injury to the domestic industries producing like or directly competitive products;
7. 
Whereas
 I find that the modifications of the concessions granted in the said agreements with respect to such articles to permit the application to such articles of the customs treatment hereinafter proclaimed is necessary to remedy the serious injury to the domestic industries producing like or directly competitive products;
8. 
Whereas
 the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications of existing duties and such additional import restrictions as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into under the said section 350; and
9. 
Whereas
, upon modification of the said concessions as hereinafter proclaimed, it will be appropriate, to carry out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to apply to the said articles the customs treatment hereinafter proclaimed:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and by section 7 (c) of the Trade Agreement Extension Act of 1951, as amended, and in accordance with the provisions of Article XIX of the said General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, do proclaim as follows:
(a) Item 391, the first item 392, item 393, and item 394, referred to in the fourth recital of this proclamation, shall each be modified, effective October 1, 1958, so as to read, respectively, as follows:
(b) The articles described in the said items entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after October 1, 1958, and until the President otherwise proclaims, shall be subject to the quantitative limitations specified in the said items, as modified by paragraph (a) above, except that no such quantitative limitation shall be applied to any article described in item 392 or item 394 or in clause numbered (1) of item 391 or clause numbered (1) of item 393 which was exported to the United States prior to the date of this proclamation.
IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
