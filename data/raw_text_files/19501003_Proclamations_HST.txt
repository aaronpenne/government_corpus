A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 free investigation and unhampered exploration of the unknown are all-important factors in our constant striving to build a better world; and
Whereas
 four hundred and fifty-eight years ago Christopher Columbus, through his bold and free inquiry into what lay beyond the ocean, found a new continent; and
Whereas
 inspiration for our present endeavors may be found in the tenacity of purpose and the unswerving quest for truth of the discoverer of America; and
Whereas
, in order to perpetuate the memory of this daring explorer and his glorious feat, the congress by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, October 12, 1950, as Columbus Day; and I direct that on that day the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the anniversary in their homes, schools, churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this third day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES E. WEBB,
