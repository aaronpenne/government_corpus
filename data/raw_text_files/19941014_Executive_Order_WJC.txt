By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701
et seq.
 ), the National Emergencies Act ("NEA") (50 U.S.C. 1601
et seq.
 ), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and taking into consideration United Nations Security Council Resolution 944 of September 29, 1994,
I, William J. Clinton, President of the United States of America, find that the restoration of a democratically elected government in Haiti has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States previously posed by the policies and actions of the
de facto
 regime in Haiti and the need to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12775 of October 4, 1991, to deal with that threat.
I hereby revoke Executive Order Nos. 12775, 12779, 12853, 12872, 12914, 12917, 12920, and 12922 and terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12775 with respect to Haiti.
Pursuant to section 202 of the NEA (50 U.S.C. 1622), termination of the national emergency with respect to Haiti shall not affect any action taken or proceeding pending not finally concluded or determined as of the effective date of this order, or any action or proceeding based on any act committed prior to the effective date of this order, or any rights or duties that matured or penalties that were incurred prior to the effective date of this order.
This order shall take effect at 12:01 a.m. eastern daylight time on October 16, 1994.
William J. Clinton
The White House,
October 14, 1994.
