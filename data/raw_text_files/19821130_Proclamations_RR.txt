By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Headnote 2 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), hereinafter referred to as the "TSUS", provides, in relevant part, as follows: 
"(i) ... if the President finds that a particular rate not lower than such January 1, 1968, rate, limited by a particular quota, may be established for any articles provided for in items 155.20 or 155.30, which will give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he shall proclaim such particular rate and such quota limitation, . . ." 
"(ii) ... any rate and quota limitation so established shall be modified if the President finds and proclaims that such modification is required or appropriate to give effect to the above considerations; . . ." 
2. Headnote 2 was added to the TSUS by Proclamation No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (82 Stat. 1455) to carry out a provision in the Geneva (1967) Protocol of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Note 1 of Unit A, Chapter 10, Part I of Schedule XX; 19 U.S.T., Part II, 1282). The Geneva Protocol is a trade agreement that was entered into and proclaimed pursuant to section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a)). Section 201(a) of the Trade Expansion Act authorizes the President to proclaim the modification or continuance of any existing duty or other import restriction or such additional import restrictions as he determines to be required or appropriate to carry out any trade agreement entered into under the authority of that Act. 
3. Headnote 3 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the TSUS was modified by Proclamation No. 4941 of May 5, 1982 (47 F.R. 19661) in order to carry out the trade agreement described in paragraph 2 of this Proclamation and the International Sugar Agreement, 1977 (T.I.A.S. 9664, 31 U.S.T. 5135). 
4. I find that the additional modifications of Headnote 3 which are hereinafter proclaimed are appropriate to carry out the trade agreement described in paragraph 2 of this Proclamation and the International Sugar Agreement, 1977 (T.I.A.S. 9664, 31 U.S.T. 5135), and give due consideration to the interests in the United States sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, Implementation Act (7 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and in conformity with Headnote 2 of subpart A of part 10 of schedule 1 of the TSUS, do hereby proclaim until otherwise superseded by law: 
A. Headnote 3 of subpart A, part 10, schedule 1 of the TSUS is further modified by adding at the end thereof the following paragraph: 
"(ij) The Secretary may exempt the entry of articles described in items 155.20 and 155.30 from the requirements or limitations established pursuant to this headnote on the condition that such articles: (1) be used only for the production (other than by distillation) of polyhydric alcohols, except polyhydric alcohols for use as a substitute for sugar in human food consumption; or (2) be re-exported in refined form or in sugar containing products. Such articles shall be entered under licenses issued pursuant to regulations promulgated by the Secretary. In promulgating such regulations, the Secretary shall give due consideration to the interests in the U.S. sugar market of domestic producers and materially affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Such regulations may contain any terms, conditions, bonds, or other limitations as the Secretary determines are appropriate to ensure that articles imported under license are used only for the purposes specified in this paragraph. This paragraph shall terminate whenever paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this headnote are terminated under paragraph (f) of this headnote.". 
B. The provisions of this Proclamation shall be effective as of the day following the date of its signing. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 30th day of Nov. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
