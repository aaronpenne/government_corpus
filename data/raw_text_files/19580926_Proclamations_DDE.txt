I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe 1960 as Visit the United States of America Year with exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to forward the purpose of promoting international understanding and world peace.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
