A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the national school lunch program, now in its nineteenth year, makes available a wholesome, appetizing lunch to over 18 million children in 70,000 schools which participate in the program; and
Whereas
 this program helps to provide many of our less fortunate children with a well-balanced and nutritious diet which enhances their vitality and their ability to obtain the maximum benefit from the learning process; and
Whereas
 the national school lunch program encourages the domestic consumption of food which is made available in unprecedented abundance through the efficiency of our farmers and our highly developed food marketing system; and
Whereas
 the national school lunch program is an outstanding example of a local-State-Federal partnership to protect the health and well-being of the Nation's children and thus to strengthen the national security; and
Whereas
, in order to recognize the value and achievements of the school lunch program, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 9, 1962 (76 Stat. 779), has designated the seven-day period beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 10, 1965, as National School Lunch Week, with ceremonies and activities designed to increase public understanding and awareness of the significance of the national school lunch program to the child, to the home, to the farm, to industry, and to the Nation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighteenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
