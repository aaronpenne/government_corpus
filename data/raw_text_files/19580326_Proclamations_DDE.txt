A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 efforts to control and eliminate cancer constitute a public service to the people of this Nation and to all mankind; and
Whereas
 recent progress against this disease has made it possible to save the lives of one out of every three cancer sufferers, thereby contributing much to the health, happiness, and productivity of our citizens; and
Whereas
 achievement of the goal of controlling and eliminating cancer demands the unrelenting efforts of research scientists, physicians, and official and voluntary health agencies, together with the enlightened cooperation of the public; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1958 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the communication industries, and all concerned groups to unite during the appointed month in the furtherance of programs for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
