By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas,
 in accordance with section 102(3) of the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, the President by Proclamation No. 3548 of August 21, 1963, proclaimed the additional import restrictions set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions On certain dairy products set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States as proclaimed by Proclamation No. 3548 have been amended by Proclamation No. 3558 of October 5, 1963, Proclamation No. 3562 of November 26, 1963, Proclamation No. 3597 of July 7, 1964, section 88 of the Tariff Schedules Technical Amendments Act of 1965 (79 Stat. 950), and Proclamation No. 3709 of March 31, 1966; and
Whereas,
 pursuant to said section 22 the Secretary of Agriculture advised me there was reason to believe that the dairy products described hereinafter are being imported, and are practically certain to be imported, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat;
Whereas,
 at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, with respect to this matter and related questions outlined in my request for an investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find that the articles described below are being imported and are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat:
(1) American-type cheese, including Colby, washed curd, and granular cheese (but not including Cheddar) and cheese and substitutes for cheese containing, or processed from, such American-type cheese;
(2) Articles containing over 5.5 percent but not over 45 percent by weight of butterfat which are classifiable for tariff purposes under item 182.91 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), the butterfat content of which is commercially extractable, or which are capable of being used for any edible purpose (except articles packaged for distribution in the retail trade and ready for use by the purchaser at retail for an edible purpose or in the preparation of an edible article); and
(3) Milk and cream, fluid or frozen, fresh or sour, containing over 5.5 percent but not over 45 percent by weight of butterfat; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that for the purpose of the first proviso to section 22(b) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the representative period for imports of such articles is the calendar years 1961-1965; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that changed circumstances require that the section 22 quotas on dairy products be changed to a calendar year basis, with semi-annual allocations when the yearly quota is periodically allocated; and
Whereas,
 at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has also made an investigation under the authority of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, to determine whether an additional quantity of Cheddar cheese could be imported without materially interfering with the price support program and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that changed circumstances require the modification, as hereinafter proclaimed, of the quota on Cheddar cheese, and cheese and substitutes for cheese containing, or processed from, Cheddar cheese; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigations and reports, I find and declare that the imposition of the import restrictions hereinafter proclaimed is necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such articles will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk and butterfat;
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended as follows:
