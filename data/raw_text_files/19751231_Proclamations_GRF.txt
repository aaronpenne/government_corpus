By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 Proclamation No. 4335 of November 16, 1974, issued pursuant to Section 252(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(a)) in response to unjustifiable restrictions imposed by Canada on meat imports from the United States, limited imports into the United States of certain cattle, beef, veal, swine and pork from Canada, and whereas that Proclamation inserted item 945.03 into sub-part B of part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), and 
Whereas,
 Canada has now lifted those unjustifiable restrictions on meat imports from the United States, and 
Whereas,
 Section 255(b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885(b)) authorizes the President to terminate in whole or in part any proclamation made pursuant to Section 252 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1882(a)), and 
Whereas,
 Proclamation No. 4382 of August 5, 1975, terminated those parts of Proclamation No. 4335 pertaining to the importation of cattle, swine and pork from Canada and 
Whereas,
 I deem it necessary and appropriate to terminate the remaining restrictions proclaimed in Proclamation No. 4335, specifically those imposing temporary quantitative limitations on the importation into the United States of certain beef and veal from Canada, in order to encourage trade between the United States and Canada. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, acting under authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 255 (b) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885 (b)) do hereby proclaim that: 
1) Proclamation No. 4335. is terminated. 
2) Subpart B of part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is amended as follows. 
(a) By deleting the superior heading immediately preceding item 945.03. 
(b) By deleting item 945.03. 
3) This Proclamation is effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after 12:01 a.m. EST, January 1, 1976. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of December in the year of our, Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
