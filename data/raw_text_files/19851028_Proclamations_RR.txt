A Proclamation
 
Hospices play an important role in our national medical care system. Terminally ill hospice patients receive expert medical care while they and their families can develop essential emotional and spiritual support. 
Hospices have shown their ability to provide appropriate, competent, and compassionate care. Under the hospice concept, each program has a team of physicians, nurses, social workers, pharmacists, psychological and spiritual counselors, and community volunteersâ€”all trained to assist the terminally ill. The team works together to care for patients and their families, especially helping them to cope with their pain and grief. 
Hospices are rapidly becoming full partners in our health care system. In November 1983, hospice care benefits became available to people under Medicare. Many private insurance carriers and employers have also recognized the value of hospice care and included hospice benefits in their health care plans. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 155, has designated the month of November 1985 as "National Hospice Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of November 1985 as National Hospice Month, and I direct the appropriate government officials, all citizens, and interested organizations and associations to observe this month with activities that recognize this important event. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-eighth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
