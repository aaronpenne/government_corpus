A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress by joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617) has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in recognition that the health of American children, like their education, should be accepted as a definite public responsibility, do hereby designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day.
And I call upon the people in each of our communities to pledge themselves today to review their community health and medical care services to see how well these services meet the needs of all our children in the light of the goals of the national health program, and to organize a definite plan to achieve within the coming year at least one improvement in community health services which will contribute to the better health of children.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 13th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES F. BYRNES,
Secretary of State.
