By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. On February 8, 1977, the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) reported to the President (USITC Publication 799) the results of its investigation under section 201(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251 (b)) (the Trade Act). The USITC determined that footwear provided for in items 700.05 through 700.85, inclusive (except items 700.51, 700.52, 700.53, 700.54, and 700.60, and disposable footwear designed for one-time use provided for in item 700.85) of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. The USITC recommended the imposition of certain tariff rate quotas on imports of the above specified articles. 
2. On April 1, 1977, pursuant to section 202(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b) (1)), and after taking into account the considerations specified in section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252 (c)), I determined to remedy the injury found to exist by the USITC through the negotiation of orderly marketing agreements with appropriate suppliers of footwear, as authorized by section 203 (a) (4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (4)); and announced my intention to negotiate such agreements calling for limits on the export from certain foreign countries, and the import into the United States, of certain footwear. On April 1, 1977, in accordance with section 203(b) (1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (b) (1)), I transmitted a report to the Congress setting forth my determination and intention to negotiate orderly marketing agreements and stating the reasons why my decision differed from the action recommended by the USITC. 
3. Section 203(e) (1) of the Trade Act ( 19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) ( 1 ) ) requires that import relief be proclaimed and take effect within 90 days after a Presidential determination to negotiate orderly marketing agreements. 
4. Pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including section 203(a) (4) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(a)(4)), orderly marketing agreements were concluded on June 14, 1977, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China, and on June 21, 1977, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Korea, limiting the export from the Republics of China and Korea, respectively, and the import into the United States, of footwear provided for in items 700.05 through 700.85, inclusive (except items 700.51, 700.52, 700.53, 700.54, 700.60, 700.75, and disposable footwear designed for onetime use provided for in item 700.85) of the TSUS. 
5. Pursuant to section 203 (k) ( 1 ) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(k)(1)), I have considered the relation of such actions to the international obligations of the United States. 
6. In accordance with section 203(d) (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(d) (2)), I have determined that the level of import relief hereinafter proclaimed permits the importation into the United States of a quantity or value of articles which is not less than the average annual quantity or value of such articles imported into the United States from the Republic of Korea, and from the Republic of China, in the 1974-1976 period, which I have determined to be the most recent representative period for imports of such articles. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and section 301 of title 3, United States code, do hereby proclaim: 
(1) Orderly marketing agreements were entered into on June 14, 1977, and June 21, 1977, between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of China and the Government of the Republic of Korea, respectively, with respect to trade in certain footwear, effective June 28, 1977. The orderly marketing agreements account for a major part of the United States imports of the articles covered by the agreements. Said orderly marketing agreements are to be implemented according to their terms and as directed in this proclamation, including the Annex thereto. 
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(3) The President's authority under section 203(e) (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e) (2)), to negotiate orderly marketing agreements with other foreign suppliers after import relief goes into effect is hereby delegated to the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (hereinafter referred to as the "Special Representative"). The President's authority under section 203 (e) (3) of the Trade Act ( 19 U.S.C. 2253 (e) (3) ) to determine that any agreement negotiated pursuant to section 203(a) (4) or 203(e) (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (a) (4) and (e) (2)) is no longer effective is hereby delegated to the Special Representative, to be exercised in conformity with paragraph (4) (a) below. In the event of such a determination, the Special Representative shall prepare any proclamations that may be appropriate to implement import relief authorized by section 203(e)(3) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e) (3)). The President's authority in section 203(g) (1) and (2) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 (g) (1) and (2)) to prescribe regulations governing the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of articles covered by the orderly marketing agreements and to issue rules and regulations governing the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of like articles which are the product of countries not parties to such agreements, has been delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to section 5 (b) of Executive Order No. 11846. Such authority shall be exercised by the Secretary of the Treasury, upon direction by the Special Representative in consultation with representatives of member agencies of the Trade Policy Staff Committee. 
(4) In exercising the authority delegated in paragraph (3) above, the Special Representative shall, in addition to other necessary actions, institute the following actions: 
(a) Should the export restraint levels specified in the orderly marketing agreements described in paragraph (1) above, and in the Annex to this proclamation be exceeded, or should imports from countries not parties to such agreements increase in such quantities as to disrupt the effectiveness of the orderly marketing agreements, the Special Representative, after consultation with representatives of member agencies of the Trade Policy Staff Committee, may make a determination that for the purposes of section 203(e) (3) of the Trade Act the orderly marketing agreements do not continue to be effective. 
(b) Beginning on June 28, 1977, if during any restraint period the quantity of imports of footwear of the types covered by the agreements, from countries other than the Republic of China and the Republic of Korea, appear likely to disrupt the effectiveness of the provisions of the orderly marketing agreements described in paragraph (1) above, the Special Representative may initiate consultations with those countries responsible for such disruptions and may prevent further entry of such articles for the remainder of that restraint period or may otherwise moderate or restrict imports of such articles from such countries pursuant to section 203(g) (2) of the Trade Act. Before exercising this authority, the Special Representative shall consult with representatives of the member agencies of the Trade Policy Staff Committee. 
(c) Should the Special Representative determine, pursuant to this proclamation, to institute import restrictions on articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption from countries other than the Republic of China or the Republic of Korea pursuant to this proclamation, such action shall become effective not less than eight days after such determination and any necessary changes in the TSUS have been published in the FEDERAL REGISTER. 
(5) The Special Representative shall take such actions and perform such functions for the United States as may be necessary concerning the administration, implementation, modification, amendment or termination of the agreements described in paragraph (1) of this proclamation, and any actions and functions necessary to implement paragraphs (3) and (4) of this proclamation. In carrying out his responsibilities under this paragraph the Special Representative is authorized to delegate to appropriate officials or agencies of the United States authority to perform any functions necessary for the administration and implementation of the agreements or actions. The Special Representative is authorized to make any changes in Part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS which may be necessary to carry out the agreements or actions. Any such changes in the agreements shall be effective on or after their publication in the FEDERAL REGISTER. 
(6) The Commissioner of Customs shall take such actions as the Special Representative shall determine are necessary to carry out the agreements described in paragraph (1) of this proclamation, and to implement any import relief implemented pursuant to paragraphs (3) and (4) of this proclamation, or any modification thereof, with respect to the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption into the United States of products covered by such agreements or by such other import relief. 
(7) This proclamation shall be effective as of June 28, 1977, and shall continue in force through June 30, 1981, unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly modified or terminated. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of June in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and seventy seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
