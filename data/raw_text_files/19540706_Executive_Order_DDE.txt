WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between the Union Carbide and Carbon Corporation and certain of its employees represented by Locals 288 and 550, United Gas, Coke, and Chemical Workers, CIO, at certain facilities of the Atomic Energy Commission located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and Paducah, Kentucky; and
WHEREAS in my opinion such dispute threatens to result in a strike affecting a substantial part of an industry engaged in trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in the production of goods for commerce, which strike, if permitted to occur or to continue, will imperil the national safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155, I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before July 20, 1954.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
