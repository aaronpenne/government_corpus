By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 3607 of August 15, 1964, I designated the years 1964 and 1965 as a period in which all persons were especially invited to see the United States; and
Whereas
 our people are striving through private initiative and through public programs at all levels of Government to preserve and develop the beauty of this land; and
Whereas
 they are touring the length and breadth of this land to observe personally the splendor of their country and through these travels are becoming increasingly aware of the destiny of their Nation; and
Whereas
 foreign tourists are seeing America and visiting her national shrines and natural wonders in mounting numbers; and
Whereas
 continuing efforts are being made to make their stay on our shores more enjoyable and to give them a better understanding of our homeland, its history, and its tradition; and
Whereas
 a number of festivals, fairs, pageants, and other ceremonials will take place in 1966 in the United States, its territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico; and
Whereas
 the Congress by the joint resolution of October 2, 1965, has requested the President to extend through 1966 the period designated to see the United States and its territories and to issue a proclamation specially inviting citizens of other countries to visit the festivals, fairs, pageants, and other ceremonials to be celebrated in 1966 in our country:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby extend through the year 1966 the period during which all persons are specially invited to see the United States, visit our historic shrines, our natural wonders, and our great recreational areas and facilities; and I extend a special invitation to citizens of other countries to visit the festivals, fairs, pageants, and other ceremonials that will take place in 1966 in the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
I also invite private industry and interested private organizations during this period to continue to encourage both American citizens and citizens of other countries to visit these festivals, fairs, pageants, and other ceremonials and to explore, use, and enjoy the scenic, historical, and recreational areas and facilities throughout the United States of America, its territories and possessions, and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
