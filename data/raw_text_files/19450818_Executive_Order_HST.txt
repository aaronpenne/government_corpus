By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, and particularly the War Mobilization and Reconversion Act of 1944, the First War Powers Act of 1941, the Second War Powers Act of 1942, as amended, and the Stabilization Act of 1942, as amended, and for the purpose of fully mobilizing the resources of the war emergency, in order to promote a swift and orderly transition to a peacetime economy of free independent private enterprise with full employment and maximum production in industry and agriculture an to assure the general stability of prices and costs and which are indispensable to the shift of business enterprises from wartime to peacetime production and of individuals from wartime to peacetime employment it is hereby ordered as follows:
I
1. The guiding policies of all departments and agencies of the Government concerned with the problems arising out of the transition from war to peace shall be:
A. To assist in the maximum production of goods and services required to meet domestic and foreign needs, (1) by assuring assistance in making available materials and supplies required for the production of such goods and services; (2) by providing assistance to the conversion and utilization of war plants and facilities, both privately and publicly owned; and (3) by providing effective job placement assistance to war workers and returning service men and women.
B. To continue the stabilization of the economy as authorized and directed by the Emergency Price Control Act of 1942, as amended, (1) by using all powers conferred therein and all other lawful means to prevent either inflation or deflation; and (2) while so doing, by making whatever modifications in controls over prices, wages, materials and facilities are necessary for an orderly transition from war to peace; and
C. To move as rapidly as possible without endangering the stability of the economy toward the removal of price, wage, production and other controls and toward the restoration of collective bargaining and the free market.
2. The departments and agencies of the Government shall take vigorous, concerted and uniform action toward these ends and pursuant to this Order, under the guidance and direction of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion.
II
During the transition to a free economy, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Federal Loan Administrator, and the Director of Economic Stabilization shall not only take all measures required by law to support prices but shall take such further measures authorized by law as may be necessary to prevent any collapse of values or discouragement of the full and effective use of productive resources.
III
The Price Administrator, and in the exercise of his price responsibilities under the law the Secretary of Agriculture, shall, subject to such directives provided for by law as may be issued by the Economic Stabilization Director, take all necessary steps to assure that the cost of living and the general level of prices shall not rise. Subject to such authority, the Price Administrator and, in the exercise of his price responsibilities under the law, the Secretary of Agriculture, are authorized to make such adjustments in existing price controls as are necessary to remove gross inequities or to correct maladjustments or inequities which would interfere with the effective transition to a peacetime economy. In order that any price increases found necessary for these purposes will not result in an increase in the cost of living or in the general level of prices, the Price Administrator and the Secretary of Agriculture respectively shall (1) so far as is reasonable, practicable and necessary for this purpose, see that such price increases do not cause price increases at later levels of production or distribution, and (2) improve and tighten price controls in those fields which are important in relation to production costs or the cost of living in which in their judgment the controls have heretofore been insufficiently effective.
IV
1. The National War Labor Board, and such other agencies as may be designated by the Director of Economic Stabilization with the approval of the Director of War Mobilization and Reconversion, are authorized to provide that employers may, through collective bargaining with duly certified or recognized representatives of the employees involved or, if there is no such representative, by voluntary action, make wage or salary increases without the necessity of obtaining approval therefor, upon the condition that such increases will not be used in whole or in part as the basis for seeking an increase in price ceilings, or for resisting otherwise justifiable reductions in price ceilings, or, in the case of products or services being furnished under contract with a federal procurement agency, will not increase the costs to the United States.
2. In addition to the authority to approve increases to correct gross inequities and for other specified purposes, conferred by Section 2 of Title II of Executive Order 9250, the National War Labor Board or other designated agency is hereby authorized to approve, without regard to the limitations contained in any other orders or directives, such increases as may be necessary to correct maladjustments or inequities which would interfere with the effective transition to a peacetime economy; provided, however, that in dispute cases this additional authority shall not be used to direct increases to be effective as a date prior to the date of this order.
Where the National War Labor Board or other designated agency, or the Price Administrator, shall have reason to believe that a proposed wage or salary increase will require a change in the price ceiling of the commodity or services involved, such proposed increase, if approved by the National War Labor Board or such other designated agency under the authority of this section shall become effective only if also approved by the Director of Economic Stabilization.
3. Officials charged with the settlement of labor disputes in accordance with the terms of Executive Order 9017 and Section 7 of the War Labor Disputes Act shall consider that labor disputes which would interrupt work contributing to the production of military supplies or interfere with effective transition to a peacetime economy are disputes which interrupt work contributing to the effective prosecution of the war.
V
The War Production Board shall move as rapidly as feasible without endangering orderly reconversion and the stabilization of the economy to free business from its controls. During the transition it shall use all of its authorized powers to expand the production of materials which are in short supply; limit the manufacture of products for which materials or facilities are insufficient; control the accumulation of inventories so as to avoid speculative hoarding and unbalanced distribution which would curtail total production; grant priority assistance to break bottlenecks which would impede the reconversion process; facilitate the fulfillment of relief and other essential export programs; and allocate scarce materials or facilities necessary for the production of low-priced items essential to the continued success of the stabilization program.
