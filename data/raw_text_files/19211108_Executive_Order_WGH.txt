Hereafter the recital immediately preceding the President's signature in proclamations, commissions, and other formal documents of like nature shall be in the following form:
Done at the City of Washington this..........day of..........in the year of our Lord.........., and of the Independence of the United States of America the.................
This order is issued to establish uniformity in the several Departments in the language used in these documents, and to restore the form which prevailed from the time the Government was established in this city, except for a brief period, when they were dated from the District of Columbia instead of the City of Washington. In the interest of economy, however, the supply of forms now on hand in the Departments may be used.
The Secretary of State will bring this order to the attention of the several Departments in Washington and he may, also, supplement it with suggestions for general uniformity in proclamations and executive orders.
