A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the human and economic well-being of our people, individually and collectively, is seriously threatened by the ravages of cancerâ€”in terms of loss of lives, protracted suffering, and significant limitation upon the economic productivity of our Nation; and
Whereas
 the medical and biological sciences are accomplishing advances of great import in the struggle against cancer through the efforts of dedicated individuals and agencies engaged in research and related activities; and
Whereas
 better health and higher health standards for our Nation and our citizens demand that the relentless assault on cancer be aided by ever-increasing support of those institutions and groups, public and private, lay and professional, which are seeking the causes and cures for cancer through research and which are involved in activities promoting the application of significant research findings, to the end that cancer may be ultimately conquered; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1957 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the press, the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, and all interested agencies and individuals to unite during the appointed month in public support of programs for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-ninth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
