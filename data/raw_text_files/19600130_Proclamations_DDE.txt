A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the national defense of the United States, its domestic economy, and its commerce with the nations of the world require efficient, modern, and dependable transportation facilities and personnel; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that recognition be given to the development and maintenance of the American transportation system, which has contributed so extensively to the growth, culture, and prosperity of our people in peaceful trade and commerce, and in effective logistic support of our armed forces; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President annually to issue a proclamation designating the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day and urging the people of the United States—including labor, management, users, and investors in all communities served by any of the various forms of transportation by land, by water, and by air—to observe this occasion by appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, May 20, 1960, as National Defense Transportation Day, and I urge our people to join in the observance of this day, in collaboration with the transportation industry and representatives of the armed forces and other governmental agencies, and to participate in the observance of this occasion by appropriate ceremonies.
I also invite the Governors of the States to provide for the observance of National Defense Transportation Day in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the citizens of each community to recognize and appreciate fully the vital role of a great modern transportation system in their daily lives and in our national defense.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirteenth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
