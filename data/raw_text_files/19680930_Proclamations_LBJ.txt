A Proclamation
 
On October 12, we honor the memory of the great Italian navigator, Christopher Columbus, who sailed forth on uncharted seas in a voyage that was to change the history of the world.
The breadth of his imagination, the force of his determination, and the magnitude of his achievement have not dimmed with the passing of time.
We are all spiritual heirs of Christopher Columbus. His unbounded faith and courage are a part of the patrimony of every American.
In recognition of our debt to Columbus the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to proclaim October 12 of each year as Columbus Day for the observance of the anniversary of the discovery of America.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States. of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 12, 1968, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand, this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
