A Proclamation
 
Whereas the Constitution of the United States of America provides that the President may, on extraordinary occasions, convene both Houses of Congress; and
Whereas an extraordinary occasion exists for convening Congress, and divers weighty matters claim their consideration:
I have therefore thought it necessary to convene, and I do by these presents convene, the Congress of the United States of America at the city of Philadelphia, in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, on Monday, the 15th day of May next, hereby requiring the Senators and Representatives in the Congress of the United States of America, and every of them, that, laying aside all other matters and cares, they then and there meet and assemble in Congress in order to consult and determine on such measures as in their wisdom shall be deemed meet for the safety and welfare of the said United States.
In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.
Done at the city of Philadelphia, the 25th day of March A. D. 1797, and of the Independence of the United States of America the twenty-first.
JOHN ADAMS.
