A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress of the United States has designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing on September 17, 1787, of the Constitution of the United States and in recognition of all who, by coming of age or by naturalization, enjoy the privileges and bear the responsibilities of citizenship; and
Whereas
 the profound meaning of the Constitution for each of us has become more clear and compelling than ever in this age of peril for the priceless blessings we enjoy as citizens of the United States; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid resolution authorizes the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Thursday, September 17, 1953, and urge the people of the Nation to display the flag on that day at their homes and other suitable places.
I also urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as patriotic, religious, civic, educational, and other interested organizations, to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on Citizenship Day to summon to the minds of all of us a keener awareness of our rights and responsibilities as citizens.
And I call upon all our citizens to renew and reaffirm on Citizenship Day their allegiance to the principles and ideals to which our Constitution gives historic testimony, so that we may fortify in our hearts that spiritual unity which is our greatest strength.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 7th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
