A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Nation needs the services of every person capable of productive work in its gigantic task of mobilizing to meet the requirements of defense and to maintain the civilian economy; and
Whereas
 the physically handicapped of our Nation have demonstrated that they are capable workers when placed in jobs suited to their abilities, training, and experience, and therefore, as a group, constitute a valuable resource of manpower; and
Whereas
 there is a continuing need for public support of informational and educational work in securing employment for the physically handicapped on the basis of their demonstrated abilities; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and requested the President to issue a suitable proclamation inviting Nation-wide support of programs calling for full opportunity for physically handicapped men and women in employment:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 7, 1951, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week in carrying out the purposes of the aforementioned joint resolution of Congress, I also call upon the Governors of States, the mayors of municipalities, and other public officials, as well as leaders of industry and labor, of civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, and fraternal organizations, and of other groups representative of our national life, to lend their assistance and encouragement in the observance of the designated week, in order to enlist public interest in and support of programs for the employment of the physically handicapped.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 17th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
