By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress meeting in Philadelphia adopted as a flag for the new nation a banner of 13 alternating red and white stripes and 13 white stars in a blue field. After nearly 200 years of history, only the constellation of stars in the flag has changedâ€”from 13 to 50. The flag of the United States still symbolizes the dignity of man as it did when those early Americans created it. It evokes for us, besides, the memories of turbulent years and calm years, of men and women who have served its ideals in battle and in peace.
We honor the flag for what it is and for what it demands of us.
The Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance. The Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 9, 1966 (80 Stat. 194), also requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the week in which June 14 occurs as National Flag Week and calling upon all citizens to display the flag of the United States on those days.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 14, 1970, as National Flag Week, and I direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings during that week.
I also request the people of the United States to observe Flag Day, June 14, and Flag Week by flying the Stars and Stripes at their homes and other suitable places.
I urge the communications media to participate in and to promote this observance.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
