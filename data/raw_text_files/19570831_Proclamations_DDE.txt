A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is fitting that all citizens, rural and urban, should recognize their interdependence in contributing to the strength, character, and prosperity of our Nation; and
Whereas
 it is increasingly important that the public should understand the mutuality of interests of those who live on farms and those who live in cities; and
Whereas
 the productivity of the farms and of urban labor and business continues to provide the food, the tools, the services, and the goods that afford our citizens the highest standard of living in the world; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 31st, 1957, has designated the week of November 22 to November 28, 1957, as National Farm-City Week, and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for suitable observance of that week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people throughout the country to participate fully in the observance of the period from November 22 to November 28, 1957, as National Farm-City Week; and I request the Department of Agriculture, the land-grant colleges, the Agricultural Extension Service, and all other appropriate agencies and officials of the Government, to cooperate with National, State, and local farm organizations and other groups in the several States and counties in preparing and carrying out programs for the appropriate observance of National Farm-City Week, including plans for public meetings, discussions, exhibits, pageants, and press, radio, and television features, with special emphasis on notable achievements by rural groups and individuals, local, State, and National, and on the enrichment of American country living through adequate cultural, spiritual, educational, recreational, and health facilities for both rural youth and rural adults.
I also request urban groups to join in this observance, along with farm groups, as evidence of our appreciation of all those on the farms and in the cities of this Nation who have worked so well in providing us with the food, the fiber, and the products that we need and enjoy.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this thirty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
