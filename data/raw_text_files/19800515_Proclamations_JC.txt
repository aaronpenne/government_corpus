By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On January 26, 1979, by Proclamation 4634, I proclaimed pursuant to the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including section 203 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2253) (the Trade Act), certain temporary quantitative limitations on the importation into the United States of color television receivers and certain subassemblies thereof, provided for in items 923.74 through 923.83, inclusive, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). 
Exports to the United States of color television receiver subassemblies, provided for in item 923.78, and subject to Proclamation 4634, fell considerably below the restraint level established by that Proclamation for the first restraint period. The existing carryover provision would allow an increase in the quantity to be entered during the second restraint period of only 29,700 units of such subassemblies. In the interest of equity, this Proclamation will increase the allowable carryover by 5,300 units to 35,000 units. The total number of such subassemblies exported to the United States and entered during the fifteen months covered by Proclamation 4634 will remain less than the number originally contemplated by that Proclamation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in order to assure equitable treatment under Proclamation 4634 and acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including section 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 U.S.T. (pt. 2) 1786) do proclaim that Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth. 
JIMMY CARTER
