By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Each year our Nation designates Mother's Day as a moment of special tribute and appreciation for the mothers of America. 
Recent years have brought many changes to the lives of American mothers. Today they are increasingly involved in business, politics, education, arts, sciences, and government as well as the vital work of .the home and family. Yet, whether they seek careers outside the home or work as homemakers, they remain the heart of the American family. 
They shape the character of our people through the love and nurture of their children. It is the strength they give their families that keeps our Nation strong. 
On this Mother's Day, we express our deep personal gratitude to our own mothers and thank all those women whose devotion to their families helps sustain a healthy and productive citizenry. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, May 10, 1981, as Mother's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Federal Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth. 
RONALD REAGAN
