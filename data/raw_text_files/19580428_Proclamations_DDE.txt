By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U. S. C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me he had reason to believe that tung nuts are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to tung nuts and tung oil, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic tung nuts or tung oil with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
Whereas
, on February 19, 1958, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation, and has reported to me its findings and recommendation made in connection therewith; and
Whereas
, on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that tung nuts are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to interfere materially with the said price-support program; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the limitations on imports of tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of tung nuts will not materially interfere with the said price-support program; and
Whereas
, on September 9, 1957, I issued Proclamation No. 3200 (22 F. R. 7265) limiting the quantity of tung oil that may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the periods specified in that proclamation; and
Whereas
 I find that the limitations on imports of tung nuts hereinafter proclaimed will not reduce the permissible total quantity of tung nuts which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption to proportionately less than 50 per centum of the average annual quantity of tung nuts entered during the representative period from November 1, 1952, to October 31, 1956, inclusive:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that no tung nuts shall be permitted to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any quota period specified in the proclamation of September 9, 1957, after the total aggregate quantity of tung nuts and tung oil entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any such quota period has reached, in terms of oil, the equivalent of the quota for tung oil specified in that proclamation for such quota period. For the purposes of this proclamation the oil content of tung nuts shall be computed on the basis of 15.9 pounds for each 100 pounds of whole nuts, and on the basis of 35.8 pounds of oil for each 100 pounds of decorticated nuts.
In order to assure equitable treatment to supplying countries, all tung oil and tung nuts entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption pursuant to the proclamation of September 9, 1957, or this proclamation, shall have been a direct shipment destined to the United States on an original through bill of lading from the country of production.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 28th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
