A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the civilian population of the Republic of Korea has suffered crushing hardships as a result of the brutal attack launched against that Republic in June 1950; and
Whereas
 private relief agencies have done magnificent work in lessening the privations and afflictions of civilians in Korea, and yet these agencies need still greater support than they have thus far received; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on June 6, 1953, has requested the President of the United States to officially set aside the week beginning June 7, 1953, as a period in which the American people may demonstrate their friendship and affection for the distressed people of the Republic of Korea:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby officially proclaim the week of June 7-14, 1953, as "Aid to Korea Week"; and, as a practical demonstration of our friendship and sympathy for the people of the Republic of Korea, I call upon those of our people who have not yet contributed to this cause to make generous contributions to it during that Week, and I urge those who can increase their past contributions to do so, to the end that the private relief agencies may be enabled to help more effectively in the monumental task of rehabilitating the millions of injured, destitute, and homeless Koreans.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
