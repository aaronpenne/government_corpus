By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Among the noblest acts of personal generosity is the gift of one's blood for the benefit of another. It is a contribution to health and life for which there is no substitute.
The voluntary blood donor system developed by the American Red Cross and the American Association of Blood Banks provides modern methods for safe and simple donations of blood. Contributions of the voluntary blood donor should be recognized and encouraged to assure that our Nation's growing need is safely met.
To this end, the Congress by Senate Joint Resolution 223 has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the month of January 1971 as National Blood Donor Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of January 1971 as National Blood Donor Month. I call upon the public media, the blood-banking and medical and health facilities of our country, and the public at large to pay special tribute and honor during that month to the voluntary blood donor and to encourage, by all appropriate means, increasing numbers of people to be voluntary blood donors.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
