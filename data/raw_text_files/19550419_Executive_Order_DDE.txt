WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 10309 of December 3, 1951, the President of the United States directed that possession, use, and control of certain lands reserved for military purposes be restored to the Territory of Hawaii and that title to such lands be transferred to the Territory, subject to the conditions contained in such order; and
WHEREAS the description of course 6 of Tract No. 1 described in the said Executive order is erroneous; and
WHEREAS there was excepted and excluded from the application of the said Executive Order No. 10309 a portion of the said Tract No. 1, containing 6,920 square feet or 0.16 acre, because such land had been transferred to the control and jurisdiction of the Secretary of War (now Secretary of the Army) by letter of the Secretary of Labor (Immigration Service) dated December 16, 1939, pursuant to the act of Congress approved August 5, 1939, 53 Stat. 1209; and

WHEREAS it is deemed desirable and in the public interest that the said error in description be corrected, and that the provisions of Executive Order No. 10309 be made applicable to the said 0.16 acre of land:
