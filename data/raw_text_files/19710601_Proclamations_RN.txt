By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Since its establishment in 1898 as the only national professional organization in its field, the Medical Library Association has devoted itself to making the vast treasures of biomedical development accessible to science. The Association has been responsible for advancing the practice of medical library science, improving the professional standards of medical libraries, and maintaining a liaison with other organizations dedicated to the improvement of health.
As a tribute to our medical librarians, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 103, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating June 1, 1971, as Medical Library Association Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, June 1, 1971, as Medical Library Association Day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this first day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
