Establishing an Emergency Board to Investigate a Dispute Between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation and Certain of its Employees Represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers 
A dispute exists between the Port Authority Trans-Hudson Corporation and certain of its employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers. 
The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (the "Act"). 
Parties empowered by the Act have requested that the President establish an emergency board pursuant to Section 9A of the Act (45 U.S.C. Section 159a). 
Section 9A(c) of the Act provides that the President, upon such a request, shall appoint an emergency board to investigate and report on the dispute. 
Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me by Section 9A of the Act, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Establishment of Board. There is established, effective July 13, 1988, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The Board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds. 
Sec. 2. Report. The Board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days after the date of its creation. 
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 9A(c) of the Act, from the date of the creation of the Board and for 120 days thereafter, no change, except by agreement of the parties, shall be made by the carrier or the employees in the conditions out of which the dispute arose. 
Sec. 4. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in section 2 of this Order.
