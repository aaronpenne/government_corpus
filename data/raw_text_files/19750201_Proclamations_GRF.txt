A Proclamation
 
RESERVING CERTAIN LANDS ADJACENT TO AND ENLARGING THE BOUNDARIES OF THE BUCK ISLAND REEF NATIONAL MONUMENT IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS OF THE UNITED STATES 
The Buck Island Reef National Monument, situated off the northeast coast of Saint Croix Island in the Virgin Islands of the United States, was established by Proclamation No. 3443 of December 28, 1961 (76 Stat. 1441). It now has been determined that approximately thirty acres of submerged land should be added to the monument site in order to insure the proper care and management of the shoals, rocks, undersea coral reef formations and other objects of scientific and historical interest pertaining to this National Monument. 
These thirty acres of submerged lands are presently owned in fee by the United States. They will be conveyed to the Government of the Virgin Islands on February 3, 1975, pursuant to Section 1(a) of Public Law 93-435 (88 Stat. 1210) , unless the President, under Section 1(b ) (vii) of that Act, designates otherwise. 
Under Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), the President is authorized to declare by public Proclamation objects of historic or scientific interest that are situated upon the lands owned or controlled by the Government of the United States to be national monuments, and may reserve as a part thereof parcels of land, the limits of which in all cases shall be confined to the smallest area compatible with the proper care and management of the objects to be protected. The aforementioned thirty acres of submerged lands are contiguous to the site of the Buck Island Reef National Monument, constitute a part of the ecological community of the Buck Island Reef, and will not enlarge the monument boundaries beyond the smallest area compatible with its proper care and management. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 1(b) (vii) of Public Law 93-435 (88 Stat. 1210), do hereby proclaim that the lands hereinafter described are excepted from the transfer to the Government of the Virgin Islands under Section 1(a) of Public Law 93-435; and, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), do hereby proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, the lands hereinafter described are hereby added to and made a part of the Buck Island Reef National Monument, and Proclamation No. 3443 of December 28, 1961, establishing the Buck Island Reef National Monument is amended accordingly.
