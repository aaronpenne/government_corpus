By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Since the beginning of history, coins have helped to tell the story of civilization. They frequently reflect the economic development of their country of origin as well as the scientific advancement and artistic values of the people who produce and use them. Today, more than ten million Americans collect coins both for pleasure and for profit.
In honor of our Bicentennial year, we are changing the designs on the backs of three United States coins. The new designs were selected through competition among the Nation's sculptors and will appear on the backs of the dollar, half dollar, and quarter. The double date 1776-1976 will appear on the front of the three coins.
When in circulation, these Bicentennial coins will reach every citizen and serve as reminders of our rich national heritage and continuing dedication to freedom and self-government.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, in recognition of this worthwhile hobby and of the significance of coins in marking the Bicentennial, do hereby designate the week beginning April 21, 1974, as National Coin Week.
Observance of National Coin Week will give us all an opportunity to reflect upon the designs, mottos, and symbols that appear on our coins. The word "Liberty" has been inscribed on our coins since 1792 as provided by the act directing our fledgling Nation to produce its own coins. Then, as now, the inscription serves as a constant reminder of our most precious national possession, won for us all in the American Revolution.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
