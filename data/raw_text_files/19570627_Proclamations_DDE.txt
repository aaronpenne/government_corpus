By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me that there was reason to believe that rye, rye flour, and rye meal are practically certain to be imported into the United States after June 30, 1957, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to rye pursuant to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
Whereas
, on May 11, 1957, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under the said section 22 with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the said Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas
, on the basis of the said investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that rye, rye flour, and rye meal, in the aggregate, are practically certain to be imported into the United States after June 30, 1957, under such conditions and in such quantities as to interfere materially with and to tend to render ineffective the said price-support program with respect to rye, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which said price-support program is being undertaken; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption after June 30, 1957, of rye, rye flour, and rye meal will not render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said price-support program:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that—
(1) the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in each of the 12-month periods beginning July 1 in 1957 and in 1958 shall not exceed 186,000,000 pounds, of which not more than 15,000 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal, which permissible total quantities I find and declare to be proportionately not less than 50 per centum of the total quantity of such rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the representative period July 1, 1950, to June 30, 1953, inclusive, and
(2) during each such 12-month period, of the foregoing permissible total quantity, not more than 182,280,000 pounds shall be imported from Canada and not more than 3,720,000 pounds shall be imported from other foreign countries.
The provisions of this proclamation shall not apply to certified or registered seed rye for use for seeding and crop-improvement purposes, in bags tagged and sealed by an officially recognized seed-certifying agency of the country of production, if—
(a) the individual shipment amounts to 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) or less, or
(b) the individual shipment amounts to more than 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) and the written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture or his designated representative is presented at the time of entry, or bond is furnished in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Customs in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise as set forth in the entry, plus the estimated duty as determined at the time of entry, conditioned upon the production of such written approval within six months from the date of entry.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 27th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
