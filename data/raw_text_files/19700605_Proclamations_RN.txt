By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
June 5, 1970, marks the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Women's Bureau of the United States Department of Labor which has for half a century served as protector of the welfare of American women wage earners.
The Women's Bureau since its founding has continually defined the changing role of women in our society and has helped them to make increasingly significant contributions as workers, homemakers and citizens.
The Bureau has provided informed, active leadership in advancing the economic, social, civil, and political status of all women. It has been a leader in seeking equal opportunity for advancement and freedom of choice for all people, and it has been a standard bearer for an end to sex discrimination in employment and education throughout the country.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim June 5 through June 13, 1970, as a period to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labor. I request that all citizens lend their support to those activities that give recognition to the achievements of the Women's Bureau in encouraging the use of the talents and skills of "America's Womanpowerâ€”A National Resource."
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
