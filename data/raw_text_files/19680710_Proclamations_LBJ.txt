By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212) authorizes and requests the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation cads year designating the third week in July as "Captive Nations Week" until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world; and
Whereas
 human freedom, national independence, and justice are fundamental rights of all peoples; and
Whereas
 the enjoyment of these rights, to which all peoples justly aspire, remains severely limited or denied in many areas of the world; and
Whereas
 the United States of America, in keeping with the principles on which it was founded, has sought consistently to promote the observance of fundamental human rights throughout the world;
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 14, 1968 as Captive Nations Week.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 10th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
