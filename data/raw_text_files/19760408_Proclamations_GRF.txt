By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
When our Nation's founders met two hundred years ago m Philadelphia to declare our independence, they categorized in unambiguous terms the reasons that compelled them to embark upon such a momentous and irrevocable course. "Cutting off our Trade with all Parts of the World" was high on the list of grievances. 
The patriots who declared independence in 1776 set the United States on the path to leadership in the interdependent world of 1976. Their action enabled us, over a period of two centuries, to construct a firm foundation of commercial alliances with nations around the globe. Last year our two-way trade with other nations amounted to $204 billion, with a record trade surplus of more than $11 billion. 
America's performance in the world marketplace is a true measure of the quality of American products, the extent of American ingenuity, and the dedication of American labor and industry to international commerce. Trade has been indispensable to our economic growth, to the greater well-being of our citizens, and to peaceful progress in our relationships abroad. It remains indispensable as we look to the new horizons of our third century. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 16, 1976, as World Trade Week. I call upon all Americans to join with business, labor, agricultural, educational, professional and civic groups, and public officials at all levels of Government, in observing World Trade Week with appropriate activities and ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
