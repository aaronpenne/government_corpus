Arthur S. Flemming, Commissioner, Administration on Aging, and Chairman, Commission on Civil Rights, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age as of June 30, 1975, under the provisions of Section 8335 of Title 5 of the United States Code, unless exempted by Executive order. 
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Arthur S. Flemming be exempted from such mandatory retirement.
