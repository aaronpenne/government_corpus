A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 in the opening of the Cheyenne and Arapahoe ceded Indian lands in the Territory of Oklahoma, by proclamation dated April 12, 1892, pursuant to section sixteen of the act of Congress approved March 3, 1891 (26 Stat., 989, 1026), the south one-half of section fifteen, township seventeen north, range twenty-two west, of the Indian Principal Meridian, was reserved for county-seat purposes for county "E," now Day county, in said Territory;
And Whereas,
 it appears that the county-seat of said county was removed from said land to the town of Grand in said county in 1893, and that said land has not since been used for county-seat purposes, and is not now needed for such purposes, and no entry has been made thereof;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section sixteen of said act of Congress of March 3, 1891, do hereby declare and make known that said land is hereby opened to settlement and restored to the public domain, to be disposed of under the provisions of section sixteen of said act of Congress of March 3, 1891, and all other laws and agreements applicable thereto.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 12th day of August in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and three, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-eighth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
