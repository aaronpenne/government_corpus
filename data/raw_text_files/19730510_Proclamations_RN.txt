By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 are set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believes that additional quantities of dried milk provided for in item 950.02 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter referred to as "nonfat dry milk") may be entered for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas
, under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has determined and reported to me that a condition exists with respect to nonfat dry milk which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on nonfat dry milk should be increased during the period ending June 30, 1973, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the entry during the period ending June 30, 1973, of an additional quantity of 60,000,000 pounds of nonfat dry milk will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and that a condition exists which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on nonfat dry milk should be increased during such period without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that subdivision (vi) of headnote 3 (a) of Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended to read as follows:
(vi) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, 25,000,000 pounds of dried milk described in item 115,50 may be entered during the period beginning December 30, 1972, and ending February 15, 1973, and 60,000,000 pounds of such milk may be entered during the period beginning the day after the date of issuance of this proclamation and ending June 30, 1973, in addition to the annual quota quantity specified for such article under item 950.02, and import licenses shall not be required for entering such additional quantities. No individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity (including its affiliates or subsidiaries) may during such period enter pursuant to this provision quantities of such additional dried milk totaling in excess of 2,500,000 pounds.
The 60,000,000 pound additional quota quantity provided for herein shall continue in effect pending Presidential action upon receipt of the report and recommendations of the Tariff Commission with respect thereto.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
