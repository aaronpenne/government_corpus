Hon. JOHN HAY,
 Secretary of State
 
You will notify the President of Hawaii that the Government of Hawaii has no power to make any sale or dispose of the public lands in the Islands. That all proceedings taken or pending for such sale or disposition should be discontinued and that if any sales or agreements for sale have been made since the adoption of the Resolution of Annexation the purchasers should be notified that the same are null and void and any consideration paid to the legal authorities on account thereof should be refunded.
