By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 504(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2464(a)(1)), the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of the duty-free treatment afforded under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) with respect to any article or any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)). Accordingly, after taking into account the factors set forth in section 501 of the Trade Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to withdraw the duty-free treatment afforded under the GSP to imports from all designated beneficiary developing countries of molybdenum ore and metal-bearing materials in chief value of molybdenum, provided for in items 601.33 and 603.40, respectively, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). 
2. Section 604 of the Trade Act authorizes the President to embody in the TSUS the substance of the relevant provisions of that Act, of other acts affecting import treatment, and of actions taken thereunder. Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 501, 504(a)(1), and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) In order to withdraw the duty-free treatment afforded under the GSP to certain articles, TSUS items 601.33 and 603.40 are modified by deleting from each item the symbol "A," appearing in parentheses in the Rates of Duty Special column. 
(2) The modifications to the TSUS made by paragraph (1) of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the second day after the publication of this Proclamation in the Federal Register. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 23rd day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
