A Proclamation
This year marks the one hundred and eighty-seventh anniversary of the heroic death of Casimir Pulaski. A Polish patriot in exile, he offered his services to the Continental Army and, in valiant defense of freedom, gave his life to America in our war for independence.
General Pulaski was acclaimed by the Congress and the people for his brilliant military leadership at Brandywine and awarded the rank of brigadier general.
Later, he formed and led an independent corps of cavalry and light infantry known as Pulaski's Legion. He died of wounds received while leading a cavalry charge during the siege of Savannah, Georgia.
In this Millennial Year, as we observe the One Thousandth Anniversary of Polish Nationhood and Culture, it is especially fitting that we again honor the deeds of this gallant Polish soldier who served our Nation in its infancy. In so doing, we acknowledge gratefully the many contributions with which our citizens of Polish heritage have enriched American culture and aided the progress of our Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 11, 1966, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Under Secretary of State
