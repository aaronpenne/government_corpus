In the exercise of the vested in the President by the Constitution and the resolution of Congress of April 5, 1917, the following order is issued. 
The head of a department or independent office may forthwith remove any employee when he has ground for believing that the retention of such employee would be inimical to the public welfare by reason of his conduct, sympathies or utterances, or because of other reasons growing out of the war. Such removal may be made without other formality than that the reasons shall be made a matter of confidential record, subject, however, to inspection by the Civil Service Commission. 
This order is issued solely because of the present international situation, and will be withdrawn when the emergency is passed. 
WOODROW WILSON
