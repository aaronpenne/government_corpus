A Proclamation
 
Section 104(b)(5) of title 17 of the United States Code provides that when the President finds that a particular foreign nation extends, to works by authors who are nationals or domiciliaries of the United States of America or to works first published in the United States, copyright protection on substantially the same basis as that on which the foreign nation extends protection to works of its own nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in that nation, the President may by proclamation extend protection under that title to works of which one or more of the authors is, on the date of first publication, a national, domiciliary, or sovereign authority of that nation, or which are first published in that nation. 
Satisfactory assurances have been received that as of the entry into force date, August 1, 1989, of the Agreement between the Government of the Republic of Indonesia and the Government of the United States of America on Copyright Protection (hereinafter the"Copyright Agreement"), Indonesia will grant to works of United States nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the United States protection in the Republic of Indonesia on the same basis as works of Indonesian nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in Indonesia, and that such protection will also extend to works of United States nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the United States, which are in the Indonesian public domain on the day immediately prior to the effective date of the Copyright Agreement, if such works still enjoy copyright protection in the United States. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,

I hereby request the Secretary of State to notify the Government of Indonesia that the date on whch works of Indonesian nationals and domiciliaries and works first published in the Republic of Indonesia are entitled to protection under title 17 of the United States Code is August 1, 1989, the date on which the Copyright Agreement enters into force.
