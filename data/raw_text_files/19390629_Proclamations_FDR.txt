A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the unsurveyed E 1/2 NE 1/4 SE 1/4 NW 1/4 sec. 24, T. 2 S., R. 17 W., P.M., Montana, was reserved by Executive Order No. 1216 of June 23, 1910, as the Big Hole Battlefield Monument; 
Whereas
 upon survey it has been found that the area intended to be reserved by that Executive order is the five-acre tract designated as the "Big Hole Battlefield Monument" on General Land Office supplemental plat of the survey of sec. 24, approved July 19, 1917, and described by metes and bounds as follows: 
Beginning at a point S. 0 degrees 1' W., 5.00 chs. and N. 89 degrees 42' E., 3.00 chs. from the northwest sixteenth-section corner of Sec. 24, T. 2 S., R. 17 W., M.P.M.; thence S. 0 degrees 2' W., 10.00 chs.; S. 89 degrees 42' W., 5.00 chs; N. 10 chs.; N. 89 degrees 42' E., 5.00 chs.; to point of beginning. 
Whereas
 it appears that certain public lands within the Beaverhead National Forest, adjacent to the Big Hole Battlefield Monument, are historic landmarks, forming a part of the battle grounds where Chief Joseph and a band of Nez Perce Indians were defeated by a detachment of United States Soldiers; 
Whereas
 certain other public lands within the aforesaid national forest are contiguous to the said national monument and are necessary for the proper care, management, and protection of the historic landmarks included within the monument; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to reserve all of the aforesaid public lands as a part of the said national monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 11, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and the act of June 8, 1906, c. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), do proclaim that the above-mentioned Executive Order of June 23, 1910, is hereby construed in conformity with the supplemental plat of survey approved July 19, 1917, to embrace the tract described above by metes and bounds, as well as the area erroneously reserved thereby; and that the hereinafter-described lands are hereby excluded from the Beaverhead National Forest and, subject to valid existing rights, added to and made a part of the said monument, which is hereby designated as the Big Hole Battlefield National Monument: 
Montana Principal Meridian 
T. 2 s., R. 17 W., sec. 24, lots 1 and 2, N 1/2 NW 1/4; sec. 23, E 1/2 NE 1/4 NE 1/4, E 1/2 SE 1/4 NE 1/4; comprising 195 acres. 
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any feature of this monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof. 
The Director of the National Park Service under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have the supervision, management, and control of the monument as provided in the act of Congress entitled "An act to establish a National Park Service, and for other purposes," approved August 25, 1916 (39 Stat. 535, U.S.C., title 16, secs. 1 and 2), and acts supplementary thereto or amendatory thereof. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 29th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-third.
