By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Older Americans, a resource of talent, knowledge and judgment, are essential to our effort for national renewal. As a Nation, we should recognize our debt to older Americans and the leadership they can provide for the future. 
As we move into this era of renewal, we must remember that all Americans are interdependent. We must maintain our commitment to the integrity of the Social Security system. We must work together for economic recovery, mindful that while our economic ills hurt us all, their burdens fall most heavily on those with fixed incomes. We must ensure the dignity of our Nation's older citizens through programs such as Medicare, aging services and the Older Americans Act. 
In addition to recognizing the vital importance of older Americans to our society, we must acknowledge the voluntary efforts of millions of citizens, young and old alike, to enhance the lives of older Americans. 
I urge all Americans to help older citizens continue to enrich our society by realizing their aspirations and fulfilling their potential. 
Now, Therefore, I Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May 1981 as Older Americans Month. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
