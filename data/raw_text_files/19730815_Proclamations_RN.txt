By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Leif Erikson first established ties between the Nordic countries and the New World when he and his companion Norse explorers landed on the North American continent in the 11th century. Their success in the face of formidable odds provides a memorable example of how vision and faith and courage can achieve even the most elusive goals.
From Leif Erikson's day to ours, the Nordic culture has been a major influence in shaping the American character. AS we honor his memory, we also honor the contributions of those who followed later in the path that he first traveled.
It is with these thoughts in mind that I happily comply with the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, October 9, 1973, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places across our land.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
