By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1862), and the Emergency Petroleum Allocation Act of 1973, as amended ( 15 U.S.C. 751 et seq.), Proclamation 4744, as amended, is hereby amended as follows: 
Section 1-101. Section 3-101 of Proclamation 4744, as amended, is amended by redesignating paragraph (c) and (d) and by the addition of a new paragraph (c) to read: 
"(c) The Secretary may make such adjustments to the requirements imposed by this Proclamation, as are necessary to prevent special hardship; provided, however, that no such adjustments shall be made with respect to the obligation to purchase or sell entitlements imposed by Section 2-1 of this Proclamation or the obligation to pay the gasoline conservation fees required by Section 1-1 of this Proclamation." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand on this twenty-third day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
