A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the President issued a proclamation on September 5, 1939 (No. 2351; 54 Stat. 2640), limiting imports of cotton having a staple length of 1 1/8 inches or more to an annual quota of 45,656,420 pounds, which proclamation was amended by Proclamation No. 2450 of December 19, 1940 (54 Stat. 2769), suspending the quota on cotton having a staple length of 11%6 inches or more, and by Proclamation No. 2856 of September 3, 1949 (14 F. R. 5517), changing the opening date from September 20 to February 1 for the annual quota for cotton having a staple length of 13/43 inches or more but less than 111A6 inches;
Whereas
 section 202 (a) of the Agricultural Act of 1956 (Public Law 540, 84th Congress), approved May 28, 1956, provides as follows:
Sic. 202 (a). Hereafter the quota for cotton having a staple length of one and one-eighth inches or more, established September 20, 1939, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, shall apply to the same grades and staple lengths included in the quota when such quota was initially established. Such quota shall provide for cotton having a staple length of one and eleven sixteenths inches and longer, and shall establish dates for the quota year which will recognize and permit entry to conform to normal marketing practices and requirements for such cotton.
Whereas
 I find and declare that the termination of the said Proclamation No. 2450 of December 19, 1940, and the modifications hereinafter indicated of the said Proclamation No. 2351 of September 5, 1939, are necessary in order to carry out the provisions of the said section 202 (a) of the Agricultural Act of 1956:
