A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American Merchant Marine, in helping to maintain the flow of international trade and travel, is under mounting responsibilities in connection with the determined efforts of our Nation to strengthen the forces of freedom; and
Whereas
 through the construction of new passenger liners, cargo ships, and tankers, the American Merchant Marine has made significant progress during the past year in expanding the Nation's maritime facilities; and
Whereas
 the Congress by joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), designated May 22 as National Maritime Day, thus honoring the Merchant Marine by commemorating the departure from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, of The Savannah, on the first transoceanic voyage by any steamship, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Thursday, May 22, 1952, as National Maritime Day by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes or other suitable places, and direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day in honor of our Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of American to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 30th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
