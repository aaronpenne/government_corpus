By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Since the first Poison Prevention Week was observed in 1962, we have seen a 75 percent drop in childhood accidental fatal poisonings, according to the latest figures from the National Center for Health Statistics. 
Ingestions by youngsters of household products sold in safety packaging were down as well. But, because not all substances can be packaged safely, it is up to everyone responsible for child care to guard against these dangers in the way we store, handle, and dispose of potentially hazardous household products. 
Accordingly, by joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681, 36 U.S.C. 165), Congress has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, designate the week beginning March 18, 1979, as National Poison Prevention Week. It is particularly important during this International Year of the Child that we become aware of this specific need for child protection. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
