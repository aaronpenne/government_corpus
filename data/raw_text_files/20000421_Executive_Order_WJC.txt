 Each agency shall comply with the provisions set forth in section 313 of EPCRA, section 6607 of PPA, all implementing regulations, and future amendments to these authorities, in light of applicable EPA guidance.
 (b)
 Each agency shall comply with these provisions without regard to the Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) or North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) delineations. Except as described in subsection
 (d)
 of this section, all other existing statutory or regulatory limitations or
 exemptions on the application of EPCRA section 313 to specific activities at specific agency facilities apply to the reporting requirements set forth in subsection (a) of this section.
 (c)
 Each agency required to report under subsection (a) of this section shall do so using electronic reporting as provided in EPA’s EPCRA section 313 guidance.
 (d)
 Within 12 months of the date of this order, the Administrator shall review the impact on reporting of existing regulatory exemptions on the application of EPCRA section 313 at Federal facilities. Where feasible, this review shall include pilot studies at Federal facilities. If the review indicates that application of existing exemptions to Federal Government reporting under this section precludes public reporting of substantial amounts of toxic chemicals under subsection 501(a), the EPA shall prepare guidance, in coordination with the Workgroup established under section 306 of this order, clarifying application of the exemptions at Federal facilities. In developing the guidance, the EPA should consider similar application of such regulatory limitations and exemptions by the private sector. To the extent feasible, the guidance developed by the EPA shall be consistent with the reasonable application of such regulatory limitations and exemptions in the private sector. The guidance shall ensure reporting consistent with the goal of public access to information under section 313 of EPCRA and section 6607 of PPA. The guidance shall be submitted to the AEEs established under section 301(d) of Executive Order 13101 for review and endorsement. Each agency shall apply any guidance to reporting at its facilities as soon as practicable but no later than for reporting for the next calendar year following release of the guidance.
 (e)
 The EPA shall coordinate with other interested Federal agencies to carry out pilot projects to collect and disseminate information about the release and other waste management of chemicals associated with the environmental response and restoration at their facilities and sites. The pilot projects will focus on releases and other waste management of chemicals associated with environmental response and restoration at facilities and sites where the activities generating wastes do not otherwise meet EPCRA section 313 thresholds for manufacture, process, or other use. Each agency is encouraged to identify applicable facilities and voluntarily report under subsection (a) of this section the releases and other waste management of toxic chemicals managed during environmental response and restoration, regardless of whether the facility otherwise would report under subsection (a). The releases and other waste management of chemicals associated with environmental response and restoration voluntarily reported under this subsection will not be included in the accounting established under sections 503(a) and (c) of this order.
 Sec. 502. Release Reduction: Toxic Chemicals. To attain the goals of section 204 of this order:
 (a)
 Beginning with reporting for calendar year 2001 activities, each agency reporting under section 501 of this order shall adopt a goal of reducing, where cost effective, the agency’s total releases of toxic chemicals to the environment and off-site transfers of such chemicals for treatment and disposal by at least 10 percent annually, or by 40 percent overall by December 31, 2006. Beginning with activities for calendar year 2001, the baseline for measuring progress in meeting the reduction goal will be the aggregate of all such releases and off-site transfers of such chemicals for treatment and disposal as reported by all of the agency’s facilities under section 501 of this order. The list of toxic chemicals applicable to this goal is the EPCRA section 313 list as of December 1, 2000. If an agency achieves the 40 percent reduction goal prior to December 31, 2006, that agency shall establish a new baseline and reduction goal based on agency priorities.
 (b)
 Where an agency is unable to pursue the reduction goal established in subsection (a) for certain chemicals that are mission critical and/or needed to protect human health and the environment or where agency off-site transfer
 of toxic chemicals for treatment is directly associated with environmental restoration activities, that agency may request a waiver from the EPA for all or part of the requirement in subsection (a) of this section. As appropriate, waiver requests must provide: (1) an explanation of the mission critical use of the chemical; (2) an explanation of the nature of the need for the chemical to protect human health; (3) a description of efforts to identify a less harmful substitute chemical or alternative processes to reduce the release and transfer of the chemical in question; and (4) a description of the off-site transfers of toxic chemicals for treatment directly associated with environmental restoration activities. The EPA shall respond to the waiver request within 90 days and may grant such a waiver for no longer than 2 years. An agency may resubmit a request for waiver at the end of that period. The waiver under this section shall not alter requirements to report under section 501 of this order.
 (c)
 Where a specific component (e.g., bureau, service, or command) within an agency achieves a 75 percent reduction in its 1999 reporting year publicly reported total releases of toxic chemicals to the environment and off-site transfers of such chemicals for treatment and disposal, based on the 1994 baseline established in Executive Order 12856, that agency may independently elect to establish a reduction goal for that component lower than the 40 percent target established in subsection (a) of this section. The agency shall formally notify the Workgroup established in section 306 of this order of the elected reduction target.

 (b)
 Within 9 months of the date of this order the Administrator, in coordination with the Workgroup established in section 306 of this order, shall develop a list of not less than 15 priority chemicals used by the Federal Government that may result in significant harm to human health or the environment and that have known, readily available, less harmful substitutes for identified applications and purposes. In addition to identifying the applications and purposes to which such reductions apply, the Administrator, in coordination with the Workgroup shall identify a usage threshold below which this section shall not apply. The chemicals will be selected from listed EPCRA section 313 toxic chemicals and, where appropriate, other regulated hazardous substances or pollutants. In developing the list, the Administrator, in coordination with the Workgroup shall consider: (1) environmental factors including toxicity, persistence, and bio-accumulation; (2) availability of known, less environmentally harmful substitute chemicals that can be used in place of the priority chemical for identified applications and purposes; (3) availability of known, less environmentally harmful processes that can be used in place of the priority chemical for identified applications and purposes; (4) relative costs of alternative chemicals or processes; and (5) potential risk and environmental and human exposure based upon applications and uses of the chemicals by Federal agencies and facilities. In identifying alternatives, the Administrator should take into consideration the guidance issued under section 503 of Executive Order 13101.
 (c)
 If an agency, which has facilities required to report under EPCRA, uses at its facilities less than five of the priority chemicals on the list developed in subsection (b) of this section for the identified applications and purposes, the agency shall develop, within 12 months of the date of this order, a list of not less than five chemicals that may include priority chemicals under subsection (b) of this section or other toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and/or other pollutants the agency uses or generates,
 the release, transfer or waste management of which may result in significant harm to human health or the environment.
 (d)
 In lieu of requirements under subsection (a) of this section, an agency may, upon concurrence with the Workgroup established under section 306 of this order, develop within 12 months of the date of this order, a list of not less than five priority hazardous or radioactive waste types generated by its facilities. Within 18 months of the date of this order, the agency shall develop and support goals to reduce the agency’s generation of these wastes by at least 50 percent by December 31, 2006. To the maximum extent possible, such reductions shall be achieved by implementing source reduction practices.
 (e)
 The baseline for measuring reductions for purposes of achieving the 50 percent reduction goal in subsections (a) and (d) of this section for each agency is the first calendar year following the development of the list of priority chemicals under subsection (b) of this section.
 (f)
 Each agency shall undertake pilot projects at selected facilities to gather and make publicly available materials accounting data related to the toxic chemicals, hazardous substances, and/or other pollutants identified under subsections (b), (c), or (d) of this section.
