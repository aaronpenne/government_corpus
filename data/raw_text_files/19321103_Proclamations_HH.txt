By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 at this season of the year our people for generations past have always turned their thoughts to thankfulness for the blessings of Almighty God,
Now, Therefore, I, Herbert Hoover,
 President of the United States, do set aside and declare Thursday, November 24, 1932, as a day of national thanksgiving, and I do urge that they repair to their places of public worship, there to give thanks to the beneficent Providence from whom comes all our good; and I do further recommend, inasmuch as this year marks the two hundredth anniversary of the birth of George Washington, the father of our country, whose immeasurable services to our liberties and our security are blessing perennially renewed upon us, that our people refresh their memory of his first thanksgiving Proclamation, which I append and incorporate in this present proclamation.
 BY THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA -
A PROCLAMATION
Whereas
 it is the duty of all Nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor - 
and Whereas
 both Houses of Congress have by their joint Committee requested me "to recommend to the People of the United States a day of public thanksgiving and prayer to be observed by acknowledging with grateful hearts the many signal favors of Almighty God, especially by affording them an opportunity peaceably to establish a form of government for their safety and happiness."
Now therefore I do recommend and assign Thursday the 26th day of November next to be devoted by the People of these States to the service of that great and glorious Being, who is the beneficent Author of all the good that was, that is, or that will be - That we may then all unite in rendering unto him our sincere and humble thanks - for his kind care and protection of the People of this country previous to their becoming a Nation - for the signal and manifold mercies, and the favorable interpositions of his providence, which we experienced in the course and conclusion of the late war - for the great degree of tranquillity, union, and plenty, which we have since enjoyed - for the peaceable and rational manner in which we have been enabled to establish constitutions of government for our safety and happiness, and particularly the national One now lately instituted - for the civil and religious liberty with which we are blessed, and the means we have to acquiring and diffusing useful knowledge; and in general for all the great and various favors which he hath been pleased to confer upon us.
And also that we may then unite in most humbly offering our prayers and supplications to the great Lord and Ruler of Nations and beseech him to pardon our national and other transgressions - to enable us all, whether in public or private stations, to perform our several and relative duties properly and punctually - to render our national government a blessing to all the People, by constantly being a government of wise, just, and constitutional laws, discreetly and faithfully executed and obeyed - to protect and guide all Sovereigns and Nations (especially such as have shewn kindness unto us) and to bless them with good government, peace, and concord - to promote the knowledge and practice of true religion and virtue, and the encrease of science among them and Us - and generally to grant unto all mankind such a degree of temporal prosperity as he alone knows to be best.
Given under my hand at the City of New York the third day of October in the year of our Lord 1789.
Go. Washington
 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 3d day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-seventh.
HERBERT HOOVER
