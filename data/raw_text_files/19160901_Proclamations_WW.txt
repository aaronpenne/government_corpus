A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it appears that the southeast quarter of section twenty-one, township thirty-six north, range five west, Mount Diablo Meridian, California, patented to the Central Pacific Railroad Company under its grant on March eleventh, eighteen hundred and ninety-six, has been occupied for over five years by an Indian entitled to receive the tract in allotment if it were not for the grant to the Railroad Company; 
Whereas,
 upon request of the Secretary of the Interior the said Railroad Company has agreed to reconvey the tract so occupied to the United States under the provisions of the Act of Congress approved March fourth, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, entitled "An Act For the relief of Indians occupying railroad lands in Arizona, New Mexico, or California", as amended by the Act approved April eleventh, one thousand nine hundred and sixteen, in order that it may be available for allotment to said Indian, provided that the said Railroad Company may be permitted to select in lieu thereof under the provisions of said Acts, the tract of 160 acres within the Tahoe National Forest in California, hereinafter described; and 
Whereas,
 it appears that the relinquishment is sought for the benefit of the Indian and that the tract desired in exchange by said company is of the character contemplated by the aforesaid Act of March fourth, one thousand nine hundred and thirteen, and equal in area and value to that to be relinquished; 
Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by the Act of Congress approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven (30 Stat., 11 at 34 and 36), entitled "An Act Making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes", do proclaim that the boundaries of the Tahoe National Forest in California are hereby changed to exclude therefrom the following area, to wit: The south half of the northeast quarter and the south half of the northwest quarter of section twenty-four, township seventeen north, range fourteen east, Mount Diablo Meridian. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this first day of September in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and sixteen, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and forty-first. 
WOODROW WILSON. 
By the President: 
JOHN E. OSBORNE 
Acting Secretary of State.
