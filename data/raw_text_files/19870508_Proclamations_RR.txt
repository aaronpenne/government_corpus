By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Digestive diseases represent one of our Nation's significant health problems. Each year digestive diseases affect roughly 20 million Americans. Their cost to Americans in terms of surgery, hospitalization, and time away from work is reckoned in tens of billions of dollars; but their cost in terms of suffering and mortality is incalculable. 
Fortunately, private and public support has made continuing research into digestive diseases possible. In addition, concerned organizations—including the Digestive Diseases National Coalition, the National Digestive Diseases Advisory Board, the National Digestive Diseases Education and Information Clearinghouse, and the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases—have been conducting a national public awareness program about these serious diseases and their prevention. 
In recognition of the importance of efforts to combat digestive diseases, the Congress, by Public Law 100-32, has designated the month of May 1987 as "National Digestive Diseases Awareness Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of May 1987 as National Digestive Diseases Awareness Month. I urge the people of the United States and educational, philanthropic, scientific, medical, and health care organizations and professionals to participate in appropriate activities to encourage further research into the causes and cures of all types of digestive disorders. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
