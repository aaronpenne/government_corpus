A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our law enforcement agencies play an essential role in safeguarding the rights and freedoms which have been guaranteed by the Constitution to every American citizen; and 
Whereas
 it is important that people throughout our country know and understand the problems, duties, and responsibilities of their police departments and that members of our law enforcement agencies recognize their duty to serve the people by safeguarding life and property, by protecting them against violence or disorder, and by protecting the innocent against deception and the weak against oppression or intimidation; and 
Whereas
 the Nation's police departments have grown to be modern and scientific law enforcement bodies which unceasingly provide a vital public service; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 21, 1961 (75 Stat. 94), has designated the week of May 13-19, 1962, as Police Week in recognition of the contribution the police officers of America have made to our civilization through their dedicated and selfless efforts in enforcing our laws, and has also designated May 14th as Peace Officers Memorial Day in honor of the Federal, State, and municipal peace officers who have been killed or disabled in line of duty; and 
Whereas
 that resolution requests the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe such period with appropriate ceremonies and activities: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to observe the week of May 13-19,1962, as Police Week with appropriate ceremonies in which all of our people may join in commemorating police officers, past and present, who by their faithful and loyal devotion to their responsibilities have rendered a dedicated service to their communities and, in so doing, have established for themselves an enviable and enduring reputation for preserving the rights and security of all citizens. 
I further call upon the people of the United States to observe Monday, May 14, 1962, as Peace Officers Memorial Day in honor of those peace officers who, through their courageous deeds, have lost their lives or have become disabled in the performance of duty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
