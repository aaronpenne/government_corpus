By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The past nineteen years have seen great progress in reducing accidental poisonings among children. Educational programs and the use of safety packaging have contributed considerably to the reduction in the number and severity of poisonings. 
But this progress should not occasion complacency. It is estimated that over 80,000 children under five years of age will accidentally ingest potentially poisonous substances during 1980. These accidents will occur because of the momentary carelessness of parents and guardians, and because of ignorance of poison hazards in the home. 
Protecting the lives and health of our children requires continued vigilance and increased efforts to educate every citizen to the dangers of accidental ingestion of drugs and common household products. By joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681, 36 U.S.C. 165), Congress has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, designate the week beginning March 16, 1980, as National Poison Prevention Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
