By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, subsection (b) of section 8 of Executive Order No. 10713 of June 5, 1967, as amended by Executive Order No. 11010 of March 19, 1962, and Executive Order No. 11263 of December 20, 1965, is further amended to read as follows:
"(b) (1) The Chief Executive shall be elected by the people of the Ryukyu Islands. The person having the greatest number of votes shall be the Chief Executive, provided that he shall have received at least one-fourth of the total number of votes cast. The Chief Executive shall be elected on the same day as are the members of the legislative body and shall serve a term concurrent with the term of the members of the legislative body and thereafter until his successor takes office. The first such election of the Chief Executive shall be on the same day as the legislative elections in November 1968. The legislative body shall by law establish procedures for the election of the Chief Executive, determine the qualifications for the office of Chief Executive, and provide for special elections when necessary to fill a vacancy.
"(2) In the event that a Chief Executive is not, within a reasonable period of time, as determined by the High Commissioner, elected to succeed an incumbent or to fill a vacancy, the High Commissioner may appoint a Chief Executive who shall serve until a successor is duly elected."
