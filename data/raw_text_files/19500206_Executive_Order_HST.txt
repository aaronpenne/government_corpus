WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between certain bituminous coal operators and associations and certain of their employees represented by the International Union, United Mine Workers of America, involving wages and terms and conditions of employment; and
WHEREAS in my opinion such dispute has resulted or threatens to result in a strike or lockout affecting a substantial part of the bituminous coal industry, an industry engaged in trade and commerce among the several states and with foreign nations, and in the production of goods for commerce, which strike or lockout, if permitted to occur or to continue, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Public Law 101, 80th Congress), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before February 13, 1950.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
