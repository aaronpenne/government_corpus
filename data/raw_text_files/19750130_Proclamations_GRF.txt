By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In a world plagued by violence and suffering, clergymen of all denominations help lead the human family to the "peace of God, which passeth all understanding." In a time of difficult choices and moral questioning, they point the way to the higher values of conduct. 
As God's ministers on earth, practicing the human virtues of charity, humanity and compassion, they bring us closer to each other and nearer to our Creator. 
NOW, THEREFORE, in recognition of the spiritual and special guidance of the clergy in our Country and throughout the world, I, GERALD R. FORD, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of February 2, 1975, as International Clergy Week in the United States. I call upon our people to honor these servants of God and man through appropriate activities and ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
