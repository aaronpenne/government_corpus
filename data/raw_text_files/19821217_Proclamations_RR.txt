By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
December 11, 1982, marked the one hundredth anniversary of the birth of Fiorello H. La Guardia, affectionately known as The Little Flower, who served with great distinction for twelve years in the United States House of Representatives and then for ten years as Mayor of New York City. 
With his vast energy, fiery leadership, and considerable wisdom, Mr. La Guardia contributed greatly to the betterment of the United States and New York City, in the finest tradition of public service. He was first elected to Congress in 1916 and served with distinction in that body from 1917 to 1919 and from 1923 to 1933. In 1933, Mr. La Guardia was elected Mayor of New York City, and he guided the City through the difficult days of the Depression and the early years of World War II. To this day, New York City bears strong testament to the vision and determination that marked Mr. La Guardia's administration. 
Mr. La Guardia's many accomplishments, and the honesty and fairness which characterized his work, continue to serve as a benchmark against which other careers in public service are judged, and as an inspiration to all Americans, particularly those who share his Italian heritage. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to a joint resolution of the Congress, do hereby declare December 11, 1982, as "Fiorello H. La Guardia Memorial Day", and I call upon all the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 17th day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
