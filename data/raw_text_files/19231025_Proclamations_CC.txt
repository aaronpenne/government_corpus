A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 there is located in section thirty-one, township twenty-four south, range twenty-five east, and section thirty-six, township twenty-four south, range twenty-four east of the New Mexico Principal Meridian, in southeastern New Mexico, near the town of Carlsbad, a limestone cavern known as the Carlsbad Cave, of extraordinary proportions and of unusual beauty and variety of natural decoration; and
Whereas,
 beyond the spacious chambers that have been explored, other vast chambers of unknown character and dimensions exist; and
Whereas,
 the several chambers contain stalactites, stalagmites, and other formations in such unusual number, size, beauty of form, and variety of figure as to make this a cavern equal, if not superior, in both scientific and popular interest to the better known caves; and
Whereas,
 it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving this natural wonder as a National Monument, together with as much land as may be needed for the protection not only of the known entrance, but such other entrances as may be found.
Now, therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States of America, by authority of the power in me vested by section two of the act of Congress entitled, "An Act for the preservation of American antiquities," approved June eighth, nineteen hundred and six (34 Stat., 225) do proclaim that there is hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, subject to all valid existing claims, and set apart as a National Monument to be known as the Carlsbad Cave National Monument all that piece or parcel of land in the County of Eddy, State of New Mexico, shown upon the diagram hereto annexed and made a part hereof, and more particularly described as follows: lots one and two, section thirty-one,. township twenty-four south, range twenty-five east, and section thirty-six, township twenty-four south, range twenty-four east of the New Mexico Principal Meridian.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy or remove any feature of this Monument and not to locate or settle upon* any of the lands thereof.
The Director of the National Park Service, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have the supervision, management, and control of this Monument as provided in the act, of Congress entitled, "An Act to establish a National Park Service and for other purposes," approved August twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred and sixteen (39 Stat., 535) and Acts additional thereto or amendatory thereof.
In witness whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 in the City of Washington this 25th day of October in the year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-three and of the Independence of the United States of America the One Hundred and Forty-eighth.
