By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Import limitations have been imposed on certain cheeses pursuant to the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 624. Section 701 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, P.L. 96-39 (the "Act") requires that the President proclaim limitations on the quantity of cheese of the types specified therein which may enter the United States in any calendar year after 1979. The Act provides that the annual aggregate quantity of such types of cheese entered shall not exceed 111,000 metric tons. 
2. Presidential Proclamation No. 4708 of December 11, 1979, and Presidential Proclamation No. 4811 of December 30, 1980, established quantitative limitations on imports of such cheeses as required by the Act. Such quantitative limitations appear in Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). 
3. In order to permit imports of certain cheeses from Uruguay, the quantitative limitations set forth in the Appendix to the TSUS must be modified. This modification does not affect any existing quota allocations nor increase the annual aggregate quantity of quota cheese to an amount in excess of 111,000 metric tons. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including Section 701 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 and Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, do hereby proclaim that Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is modified effective January 1, 1986, as follows:
Item 950.10 is modified by adding the following new line immediately after the line beginning with "Argentina":
"Uruguay ...........................551,150 250,000". 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth. 
RONALD REAGAN
