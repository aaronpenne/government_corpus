A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American Merchant Marine is today carrying on a long and honorable tradition of serving the trade and commerce of the world upon the high seas; and
Whereas
 American merchant ships and American seamen stand ready at all times to serve our Nation in the cause of freedom and justice; and

 we have added to the United States Program for Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy a proposal to build an atomic-powered merchant ship that will visit the ports of the world to demonstrate to people everywhere atomic energy harnessed to peacetime uses for the benefit of mankind; and
Whereas
 the Congress by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), designated May 22 as National Maritime Day, thus honoring the Merchant Marine by commemorating the departure from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, of the Savannah on the first transoceanic voyage by any steamship, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of that day; and

 since May 22 falls on Sunday this year, it is appropriate that National Maritime Day be observed on the following Monday:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our Merchant Marine on Monday, May 23, 1955, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes or other suitable places; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on Monday, May 23, in tribute to our Merchant Marine.
