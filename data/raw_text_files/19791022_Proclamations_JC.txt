By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
All too often we take for granted the close working relationship between our farms and cities. On this 25th anniversary of National Farm-City Week, we can again reflect with pride on this unique interdependence. 
It is a crucial interdependence that requires our constant attention. It determines whether our food and fiber supply will meet the needs of our citizens, our trading partners and our international humanitarian commitments. In short, it determines our future. 
National Farm-City Week is a time for our rededication to cooperation, so we as a Nation can successfully meet the challenges that lie before us. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period, November 16 through November 22, 1979, as National Farm-City Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth. 
JIMMY CARTER
