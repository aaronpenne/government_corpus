A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the productivity and effi­ciency of American agriculture provide an abundance of food and fiber without equal anywhere; and 
Whereas
 this agricultural abun­dance is vital not only to the well-being of all our people and to the strength of our Nation, but also to the freedom and economic growth of the newly emerging nations of the world with whom we share both this abundance and the technology which makes it possible; and 
Whereas
 the interdependence be­tween prosperity on the American farm and the economic health of the Amer­ican city has never been more signifi­cant; and 
Whereas
 there is urgent need for mutual recognition and appreciation of this interdependence-a need for labor, business, and industry to recognize the family farmer not only as the supplier of their food and raw materials but also as one of their best and most dependable customers, and a need for agricul­ture to recognize all Americans as cus­tomers who are entitled to better information as to the quality of the products and services provided and the fairness of their cost: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 17 through November 23, 1961, as National Farm-City Week, and I call upon the peoples throughout the Nation to participate fully in the observance of that week. 
I request the Department of Agricul­ture, the land-grant colleges and univer­sities, the cooperative, extension services, and all other appropriate agencies and officials of the Government to cooperate with National, State, and local farm organizations and other groups in preparing and carrying out programs for the appropriate observance of National Farm-City Week, including public meet­ings, discussions, exhibits, pageants, and press, radio, and television features, with special emphasis on the interdependence of the family farm and the city. 
I also request labor, business, industry, and all consumers to join in this observ­ance, along with farm groups, as evi­dence of America's appreciation of all those on the farms and in the cities who provide us with the food and fiber for better living. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
