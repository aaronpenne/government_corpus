A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212), the Congress authorized and requested the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation designating the third week in July 1959 as "Captive Nations Week," and to issue a similar proclamation each year until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world; and 
Whereas
 there exist many historical and cultural ties between the people of these captive nations and the American people; and 
Whereas
 the principles of self-government and human freedom are universal ideals and the common heritage of mankind: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 15, 1962, as Captive Nations Week. 
I invite the people of the United States of America, to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to give renewed devotion to the just aspirations of all people for national independence and human liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this thirteenth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
