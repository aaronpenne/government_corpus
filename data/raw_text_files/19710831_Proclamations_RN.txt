A Proclamation
 
On Columbus Day, 1971, we honor once more the memory of the great captain whose historic voyages led to the migration of peoples to the New World and brought fresh promises of liberty and freedom to the Old.
In this present age of epic journeys in space, we can appreciate more than ever the great achievements of Christopher Columbus. An intrepid explorer, a supreme navigator, but above all a man of unshakeable faith and courage, this son of Italy sailed in the service of the Spanish crown on a mission that forever broadened man's hopes and horizons.
We take pride in commemorating the vision and determination of Christopher Columbus, and carry forward his spirit of exploration as part of our national heritage.
In tribute to the achievements of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified by the Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 11, 1971, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand, this 31st day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
