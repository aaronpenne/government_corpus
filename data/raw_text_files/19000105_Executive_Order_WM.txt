By virtue of the authority vested in me by joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States accepting and confirming the cession of the Hawaiian Islands to the United States, it is hereby ordered and directed that out of the Government Reservation lying to the eastward of the Puowaina or Ruralhouse Hill in the Island of Ouhu, Hawaiian Islands, seven acres, more or less as hereinafter described and located, shall be set apart for the use of the United States Treasury Department as a site for a United States Marine Hospital for the port of Honolulu. This site shall consist of the seven acres situated north of the Makiki cemetery and bounded on the north and east by the sinuosities of the Punch Bowl road; on the south by a line projecting eastward from the powder magazine to intersect Punch Bowl road, this line being the southern boundary of the Government Reservation at that point; and on the west by an arbitrary north and south line drawn so as to leave seven (7) acres within this designated tract.
