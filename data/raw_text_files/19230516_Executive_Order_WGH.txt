By virtue of the power and authority vested in me by "an Act to define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy and for other purposes," known as the "Trading with the Enemy Act," approved October 6, 1917, and the amendments thereto, I hereby make the following orders, rules and regulations:
1. I hereby vest in the Alien Property Custodian all power and authority conferred upon me by the provisions of Section 9 of the Act approved October 6, 1917, known as the "Trading with the Enemy Act," as amended March 4, 1923, pertaining to every claim in which the amount to be returned or paid does not exceed in money or other property the value of Ten Thousand Dollars. The Alien Property Custodian may refer any such claim to the Attorney General for an opinion upon the law or facts upon which such claim is based.
