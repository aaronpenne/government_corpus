A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Charter of the United Nations, which came into operation on October 24, 1945, was designed as a firm foundation on which men of good will might build a world of peace and security; and
Whereas
 most of the members of the United Nations have cooperated faithfully in the effort to build such a world on the basis of the Charter; and
Whereas
 the United Nations has been engaged in the greatest effort ever made by an international organization to restore peace and security in an area of conflict; and
Whereas
 the General Assembly of the United Nations, by its resolution of October 31, 1947, declared that October 24 of each year, the anniversary of the coming into force of the Charter, should be dedicated to the dissemination of information concerning the aims and accomplishments of the United Nations, with a view to enlisting the interest and cooperation of all humanity:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the citizens of this Nation to observe Wednesday, October 24, 1951, as United Nations Day, remembering that the anniversary commemorates a landmark in the history of the human race, and that its significance should be cherished in our hearts.
I also call upon the officials of the Federal, State, and local Governments, representatives of civic, educational, and religious organizations, and agencies of the press, radio, television, motion pictures, and other media of public information, to cooperate in arranging for ceremonies and programs on United Nations Day, designed to acquaint our citizens with the activities of the United Nations, to the end that we may forward the work of this great international partnership.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
