By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Proclamation No. 4445, of June 11, 1976, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of November 16, 1976, imposed quantitative restrictions on the importation of certain articles of specialty steels. Section 203(h)(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2253 (h) (4)) permits the President to reduce or terminate any such restrictions if, after taking into account advice received from the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) and after seeking advice from the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, the President determines that the reduction or termination is in the national interest. 
2. I have sought and received advice from the USITC and from the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor concerning the effects of excluding alloy tool steel provided for in item 923.25 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) from the quantitative restrictions imposed by Proclamation No. 4445, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477. I have determined, after considering that advice, that the exclusion of alloy tool steel provided for in item 923.25, TSUS, from such quantitative restrictions is in the national interest. 
3. Accordingly, the purpose of this proclamation is to terminate in part Proclamation No. 4445 of June 11, 1976, as modified by Proclamation No. 4477 of November 16, 1976, so as to exclude alloy tool steel provided for in item 923.25, TSUS, from the present quantitative restrictions. The authority for this action is set forth in section 203(h) (4) (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (4)), and section 125(b) (19 U.S.C. 2135(b)) of the Trade Act. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 125 and 203 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135 and 2253, respectively), do proclaim that--- 
A. Subpart A, part 2, of the Appendix to the TSUS (19 U.S.C. 1202) is modified as follows:
