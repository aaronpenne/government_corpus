By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 are set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believes that additional quantities of Cheddar cheese, and cheese and substitutes for cheese containing, or processed from, Cheddar cheese provided for in item 950.08A of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) may be entered for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas,
 under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has determined and reported to me that a condition exists with respect to such cheese provided for in item 950.08A of the TSUS which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on such cheese should be increased during the period ending March 31, 1974, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the entry during the period ending March 31, 1974, of an additional quantity of 100,000,000 pounds of the cheese provided for in item 950.08A of the TSUS will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and that a condition exists which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on such cheese should be increased during such period without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that subdivision (vii) of headnote 3 (a) of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended to read as follows:
(vii) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part, 100,000,000 pounds of the articles described in item 950 08A may be entered during the period beginning January 3, 1974, and ending March 31, 1974, in addition to the annual quota quantity specified for such articles under item 950.08A, and import licenses shall not be required for entering such additional quantity. No individual, partnership, firm, corporation, association, or other legal entity (including its affiliates or subsidiaries) may during such period enter pursuant to this provision an aggregate quantity of such articles in excess of 2,500,000 pounds. The 100,000,000 pound additional quota quantity authorized to be entered during the period ending March 31, 1974, shall be allocated among supplying countries as follows:
Supplying Country--------------------------Quantity in pounds
New Zealand----------------------------------55,000,000
Australia--------------------------------------12,000,000
Other Countries-----------------------------33,000,000
The additional quota quantity provided for herein shall continue in effect pending Presidential action upon receipt of the report and recommendations of the Tariff Commission with respect thereto.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
