A Proclamation
 
Each year, more Americans discover the pleasures of boating. The nation's rivers, lakes and coastal waterways provide an ideal setting for family recreation and well-earned moments of leisure. As the popularity of boating grows, so does the need to emphasize safety in boating activities. We must recognize a mutual responsibility for our safety and the safety of others so that enjoyment of our country's natural and man-made resources does not have to be marred by tragedy. 
In light of the growth in recreational boating, and our need for safe waterways, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179, 36 U.S.C. 161), requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 4, 1976, as National Safe Boating Week. 
I urge all who take part in boating activities on American waterways to acquire a basic knowledge of boating safety. This information is readily available through numerous safe boating courses offered by organizations such as the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States Power Squadrons, the American Red Cross and the various State agencies. I urge all organizations offering boating safety instruction to increase their efforts to encourage safe boating. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
