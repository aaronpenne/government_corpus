By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The spirit of neighbor helping neighbor flows like a deep and mighty river through the history of our Nation. We are proud of our strong and uniquely American tradition of voluntarism. Compassion, vision, and a fundamental sense of decency are the hallmarks of our national character and are reflected in the charitable works of our citizens. 
During this holiday season, I call upon all Americans to reflect this spirit of generosity and cooperation by joining in partnership with others to provide food to those in need. I ask the agricultural and food industries to donate surpluses to food banks around the country and to complement government programs that are providing food assistance to low-income Americans. I look for the support of community groups, charitable organizations, and individuals in donating food items and in transporting and distributing them to those in need. Let the caring, sharing, and goodwill generated by private initiative spread across this great Nation of ours and bring joy to each and every individual. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 15, 1984, as National Care and Share Day and call upon the people of the United States to pay tribute to acts of charity and to promote community involvement in caring for the needs of our neighbors. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 3rd day of Dec., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
