By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to title V of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended ("1974 Act") (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.), the President may designate specified articles provided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States ("HTS") as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences ("GSP") when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries.
2. Pursuant to section 504(c) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)), beneficiary developing countries, except those designated as least-developed beneficiary developing countries pursuant to section 504(c)(6) of the 1974 Act, are subject to limitations on the preferential treatment afforded under the GSP. Pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act, a country that is no longer treated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to an eligible article may be redesignated as a beneficiary developing country with respect to such article if imports of such article from such country did not exceed the limitations in section 504(c)(1) (after application of paragraph (c)(2)) during the preceding calendar year. Pursuant to section 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act shall not apply with respect to any eligible article if a like or directly competitive article is not produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Further, pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(2)), the President may disregard the limitations provided in section 504(c)(1)(B) with respect to any eligible article if the appraised value of the total imports of such article into the United States during the preceding calendar year is not in excess of an amount that bears the same ratio to $5,000,000 as the gross national product of the United States for that calendar year (as determined by the Department of Commerce) bears to the gross national product of the United States for calendar year 1979.
3. Section 502(b)(7) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7)) provides that a country that has not taken or is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(4)), is ineligible for designation as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP. Pursuant to section 504 of the 1974 Act, the President may withdraw, suspend, or limit the application of duty-free treatment under the GSP with respect to any article or with respect to any country upon consideration of the factors set forth in sections 501 and 502(c) of he 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462(c)).
4. Pursuant to sections 501, 503(a), and 504(a) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461, 2463(a), and 2464(a)), in order to subdivide and amend the nomenclature of existing provisions of the HTS to modify the GSP, I have determined, after taking into account information and advice received under section 503(a), that the HTS should be modified to adjust the original designation of eligible articles. In addition, pursuant to title V of the 1974 Act, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate specified articles provided for in the HTS as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries, and that such treatment for other articles should be terminated. I have also determined, pursuant to sections 504(a), (c)(1), and (c)(2) of the 1974 Act, that certain beneficiary countries should no longer receive preferential tariff treatment under the GSP with respect to certain eligible articles. Further, I have determined, pursuant to section 504(c)(5) of the 1974 Act, that certain countries should be redesignated as beneficiary developing countries with respect to certain eligible articles. These countries have been previously excluded from benefits of the GSP with respect to such eligible articles pursuant to section 504(c)(1) of the 1974 Act. Further, pursuant to section 504(d)(1) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(d)(1)), I have determined that the limitation provided for in section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2464(c)(1)(B)) should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles because no like or directly competitive article was produced in the United States on January 3, 1985. Last, I have determined that section 504(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act should not apply with respect to certain eligible articles pursuant to section 504(d)(2) of the 1974 Act.
5. Pursuant to sections 502(b)(7), 502(c)(7), and 504 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)(7), 2462(c)(7), and 2464), I have determined that it is appropriate to provide for the suspension of preferential treatment under the GSP for articles that are currently eligible for such treatment and that are imported from Mauritania. Such suspension is the result of my determination that Mauritania has not taken and is not taking steps to afford internationally recognized worker rights, as defined in section 502(a)(4) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2462(a)(4)).
6. Pursuant to sections 501 and 502 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2462), and having due regard for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate Albania as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the GSP.
7. Proclamation 6517 of December 23, 1992, withdrew the duty-free treatment accorded under the GSP, pursuant to title V of the 1974 Trade Act, to imports of sulfanilic acid, provided for in HTS subheading 2921.42.24. Proclamation 6544 of April 13, 1993, made further modifications in the HTS provisions for such goods. Through technical error, the HTS provisions created in the annexes to such proclamations were not properly structured and numbered. Therefore, I have decided that it is necessary and appropriate to modify the HTS to correct these errors.
8. Section 604 of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2483), authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the relevant provisions. of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder, including the removal, modification, continuance, or imposition of any rate of duty or other import restriction.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
