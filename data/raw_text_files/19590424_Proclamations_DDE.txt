 the waters of the United States provide recreation for many millions of our citizens during the boating season; and

I urge all boatmen, boating organizations, the boating industry, State and Federal agencies, and all other groups interested in boating to join in this observance of National Safe Boating Week; and I call upon them to exert greater effort during that week and throughout the boating season to keep boating safe and pleasant.
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Territory of Hawaii, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the possessions of the United States to provide for the observance of this Week to encourage nationwide interest in safe boating practices.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
