By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Inasmuch
 as the War Fund of 1917 so generously contributed by the American people to the American Red Cross for the administration of relief at home and abroad, has been practically exhausted by appropriations for the welfare of the men in our military and naval forces, and for those dependent upon them, and for the yet more urgent necessities of our Allies, military and civilian, who have long borne the brunt of war; 
And, inasmuch
 as the American Red Cross has been recognized by law and international convention as the publicinstrumentality for war relief; 
And, inasmuch
 as the year of our own participation in the war has brought unprecedented demands upon the patriotism and liberality of our people, and made evident the necessity of concentrating the work of relief in one main organization which can respond effectively and universally to the needs of humanity under stress of war; 
And, inasmuch
 as the duration of the war and the closer and closer cooperation of the American Red Cross with our own Army and Navy, with the governments of our Allies, and with foreign relief organizations, have resulted in the discovery of new opportunities of helpfulness under conditions which translate opportunity into duty; 
And, inasmuch
 as the American Red Cross War Council and its Commissioners in Europe have faithfully and economically administered the people's trust; 
Now, Therefore,
 by virtue of my authority as President of the United States and President of the American Red Cross, 
I, Woodrow Wilson,
 do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 20, 1918, as "Red Cross Week", during which the people of the United States will be called upon again to give generously to the continuation of the important work of relieving distress, restoring the waste of war, and assisting in maintaining the morale of our own trooops and the troops and peoples of our Allies by this manifestation of effort and sacrifice on the part of those, who, though not privileged to bear arms are of one spirit, purpose, and determination with our warriors. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 in the District of Columbia, this 4th day of May, in the year of our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Eighteen, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the One Hundred and Forty-second. 
WOODROW WILSON 
By the President: 
Robert Lansing 
Secretary of State.
