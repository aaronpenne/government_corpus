By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. On September 17, 1979, under the authority of section 101 (a) (1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2111(a)(1)), the United States entered into a trade agreement with Canada containing concessions by the United States on five tariff items regarding imports of live cattle. Section G of Annex III of Proclamation No. 4707 of December 11, 1979, provided for the staged reductions in the rates of duty for four of the tariff items on cattle. Those staged reductions were subsequently implemented by a notice published in the FEDERAL REGISTER (45 Fed. Reg. 20603 (1980)). Implementation of the concession on a fifth tariff item was made contingent upon the conclusion of certain trade negotiations with the United Mexican States. Those negotiations were concluded on March 18, 1980. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to Title I and section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), do proclaim that: 
(1) Section G of Annex III of Proclamation No. 4707 of December 11, 1979, is amended, as provided in the Annex to this proclamation, to notify and publish the effective dates, as required by Proclamation No. 4707, and to add an additional tariff item. 
(2) The aforesaid amendment shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 1980, and as to which the liquidation of entries or withdrawals has not become final and conclusive under section 514 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1514). If applicable, reliquidation under 19 U.S.C. 1520 is authorized. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
