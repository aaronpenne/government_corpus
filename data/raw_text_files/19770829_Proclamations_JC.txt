A Proclamation
 
The Hispanic heritage of over sixteen million Americans, representing a broad diversity of cultures, has enriched our Nation by contributing to the advancement of art and science and by affirming the importance of family bonds and community spirit. 
Today, Americans have come to recognize the important role of the Hispanic community both in the life and work of the United States and in our efforts to achieve understanding, mutual respect and common purpose with the Spanish speaking nations of this hemisphere. 
In recognition of our Hispanic heritage, the Congress, by joint resolution approved September 17, 1968 (36 U.S.C. 169f), has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the week including September 15 and 16 as National Hispanic Heritage Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 1 l, 1977, as National Hispanic Heritage Week and call upon the people of the United States, especially the educational community, to observe it with appropriate ceremonies and activities; to reflect on the influence of Hispanic culture in our land; and to encourage the full participation of Hispanic Americans in every phase of American life. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of August, in the year of our Lord Nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second. 
JIMMY CARTER
