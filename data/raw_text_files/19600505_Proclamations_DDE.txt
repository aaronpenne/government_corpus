A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the character of America reflects the total character of her individual citizens; and
Whereas
 the mothers of our Nation, responsible in large measure for the physical, intellectual, and spiritual nurture of their offspring, play a vital role in forming the character of each new generation; and
Whereas
 we are grateful to every American mother who instills in her children an eagerness for knowledge and a vision of high achievement, together with devotion to their country, love of their fellow men, and faith in Almighty God; and
Whereas
, in recognition of the services rendered by American mothers, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), designated the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day and provided that it should be the duty of the President to request the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 8, 1960, be observed as Mother's Day; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Federal buildings on that day.
I urge the people of the United States to give expression on that day to their love and gratitude for their mothers, publicly by display of the flag at their homes or other suitable places and privately through prayer and thoughtful acts of affection and devotion.
I call upon all mothers to be ever mindful of their responsibility for the growth of their children into mature men and women, able and willing to participate effectively in the duties and privileges of American citizenship
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
