By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. By Proclamation No. 5164 of March 19, 1984, I imposed import fees on certain sugars, sirups and molasses pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624). 
2. The Secretary of Agriculture has advised me that he has reason to believe that changed circumstances require the termination of those import fees for articles described in item 956.15 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) and the modification of those import fees for articles described in items 956.05 and 957.15 of the TSUS. 
3. I agree that there is reason for such belief by the Secretary of Agriculture, and therefore I am requesting the United States International Trade Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter pursuant to Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended. 
4. The Secretary of Agriculture has further advised me that a condition exists with regard to the importation of those certain sugars, sirups and molasses requiring emergency treatment and therefore the import fees for articles described in TSUS item 956.15 should be suspended and the import fees for articles described in TSUS items 956.05 and 957.15 should be modified without awaiting the report and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission. 
5. On the basis of the information submitted to me, I find and declare that changed circumstances require the suspension and modification of the import fees for sugars, sirups and molasses, as described below, without awaiting the report and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, and the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim as follows: 
A. The application of the fees prescribed for item 956.15 and the provisions of headnote 4(c) of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States are suspended. 
B. Items 956.05 and 957.15 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States are amended by inserting "One cent per pound" in place of "An amount determined and adjusted in accordance with headnote 4(c)" in both places in which it occurs. 
C. The provisions of paragraph C of Proclamation No. 5164 are suspended. 
D. This proclamation shall be effective as of 12:01 a.m. Eastern Standard Time April 1, 1985, and shall remain effective pending my action upon receipt of the report and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission on this matter. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
