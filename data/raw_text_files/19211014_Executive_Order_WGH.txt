While the appointment of Presidential postmasters is not within the legal scope of the civil service law and, therefore, as a matter of law, no "preference" is applicable thereto, yet, in order that those young men and women who served in the World War, having their scholastic and business experience intercepted and interrupted thereby, may not suffer any disadvantage in the competition for such postmasterships, I direct the Civil Service Commission, in rating the examination papers of such candidates, to add to their earned ratings five points and to make certification to the Postmaster General in accordance with their relative positions thus acquired.
I further direct that the time such candidates were in the service during the World War may be reckoned by the Commission in making up the required length of business experience; and that all age limitations be waived.
