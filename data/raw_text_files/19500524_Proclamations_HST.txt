A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the strength of the United Nations depends upon the support it receives from the people throughout the world; and
Whereas
 the need for an international organization to ensure peace has never been more urgent; and
Whereas
 on October 24, 1950, the United Nations will have completed five years of existence, marked by many positive achievements in promoting cooperation among the nations; and 
Whereas
, in commemoration of the establishment of the organization, the General Assembly of the United Nations in a resolution of October 31, 1947, declared that October 24 of each year should thenceforth be known as United Nations Day and should be devoted to the spread of information about the aims and accomplishments of the United nations, with a view to gaining popular support for its work:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all the people of this Nation to observe October 24, 1950, as United Nations Day with solemn awareness of the responsibility of each individual for strengthening the devotion of the peoples of the world to the aims of the United Nations.
And I urge that officials of the Federal, State, and local Governments, representatives of civic, educational, and religious bodies, and agencies of the press, radio, television, and other media of public information, arrange for ceremonies and programs on United Nations Day, designed to inform our citizens more fully of the activities of the United Nations, through which, by united effort, enduring world peace may be achieved.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 24th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES E. WEBB,
