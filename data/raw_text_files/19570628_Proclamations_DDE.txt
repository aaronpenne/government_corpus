By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as then amended (48 Stat. (pt. 1) 943, ch. 474, 57 Stat. (pt. 1) 125, ch. 118, 59 Stat. (pt. 1) 410, ch. 269), the President on October 30, 1947, entered into a trade agreement with certain foreign countries, which trade agreement consists of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (hereinafter referred to as "the General Agreement"), including a schedule of United States concessions (hereinafter referred to as "Schedule XX (Geneva-1947)"), and the Protocol of Provisional Application of the General Agreement, together with a Final Act (61 Stat. (pts. 5 and 6), A7, All, and A2051);
2. 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. (pt. 2) 1103), the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement specified in the first recital of this proclamation on and after January 1, 1948, which proclamation has been supplemented by the other proclamations listed in the third recital of Proclamation No. 3140 of June 13, 1956 (3 CFR, 1956 Supp., p. 24), by the said proclamation of June 13, 1956, by Proclamation No. 3143 of June 25, 1956 (3 CFR, 1956 Supp., p. 33), by Proclamation No. 3146 of June 29, 1956 (3 CFR, 1956 Supp., p. 35), by Proclamation No. 3160 of September 28, 1956 (3 CFR, 1956 Supp., p. 44), and by Proclamation No. 3184 of May 16, 1957 (22 F. R. 3531);
3. 
Whereas
 I have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and of the Republic of Cuba, both being contracting parties to the General Agreement, are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purposes declared in section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as now amended (48 Stat. (pt. 1) 943, ch. 474, 57 Stat. (pt. 1) 125, ch. 118, 59 Stat. (pt. 1) 410, ch. 269, 63 Stat. (pt. 1) 698, ch. 585, 69 Stat. 162, ch. 169), will be promoted by the negotiation between these two Governments of a trade agreement supplementing the General Agreement;
4. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 3 (a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1951 (65 Stat. 72, ch. 141), I transmitted to the United States Tariff Commission for investigation and report a list of all articles imported into the United States of America to be considered for possible modification of duties and other import restrictions, imposition of additional import restrictions, or continuance of existing customs or excise treatment in the trade agreement negotiations with the Government of the Republic of Cuba referred to in the third recital of this proclamation, and the Tariff Commission made an investigation in accordance with section 3 of the said Trade Agreements Extension Act and thereafter reported to me its determinations made pursuant to the said section within the time period specified therein;
5. 
Whereas
 reasonable public notice of the intention to conduct trade agreement negotiations with the Republic of Cuba was given, the views presented by persons interested in such negotiations were received and considered, and information and advice with respect to such negotiations was sought and obtained from the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, and Defense, and from other sources;
6. 
Whereas
, the period for the exercise of the authority of the President to enter into foreign trade agreements under the said section 350, as now amended, having been extended by section 2 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 (69 Stat. 162, ch. 169) from June 12, 1955, until the close of June 30, 1958, on June 20, 1957, as a result of the findings set forth in the third recital of this proclamation, I entered, through my duly authorized representative, into a trade agreement providing for the application of the relevant provisions of the General Agreement to additional schedules of tariff concessions relating to the United States of America and to the Republic of Cuba, which trade agreement consists of the Eighth Protocol of Supplementary Concessions to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated June 20, 1957, including a schedule of United States concessions (hereinafter referred to as "Schedule XX (Havana-1957) "), which trade agreement is authentic in the English and French languages as indicated therein, and a copy of which is annexed to this proclamation;'
7. 
Whereas
 the supplementary trade agreement specified in the sixth recital of this proclamation provides that the schedule annexed thereto relating to a negotiating contracting party shall be regarded as a schedule to the General Agreement relating to that contracting party on the thirtieth day following the day on which the protocol shall have been signed by such contracting party or on June 29, 1957, which ever is the earlier, and such protocol was not signed on behalf of the United States prior to May 30, 1957;
8. 
Whereas
 I find that each modification of existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States of America and each continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America which is proclaimed in Part I of this proclamation will be required or appropriate, on and after the dates specified in the said Part I, to carry out the trade agreement specified in the sixth recital of this proclamation;
9. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350, as then amended, the President on October 30, 1947, entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba (61 Stat. (pt. 4) 3699), which exclusive trade agreement includes certain portions of other documents made a part thereof and provides for the treatment in respect of ordinary customs duties of products of the Republic of Cuba imported into the United States of America;
10. 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 2764 of January 1, 1948 ' (62 Stat. (pt. 2) 1465), the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said exclusive trade agreement specified in the ninth recital of this proclamation on and after January 1, 1948, which proclamation has been supplemented by the other proclamations listed in the thirteenth recital of the said proclamation of June 13, 1956, by the said proclamation of June 13, 1956, and by the said proclamation of May 16. 1957;
11. 
Whereas
 Part II of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947), which was made a part of the exclusive trade agreement specified in the ninth recital of this proclamation, is supplemented by Part II of Schedule XX (Havana-1957), and I find that it is required or appropriate, on and after the dates specified in the said Part II, to carry out the said exclusive trade agreement that the said Part II of Schedule XX (Geneva-1947) be applied as supplemented by the said Part II of Schedule XX (Havana-1957);
12. 
Whereas
 by the said proclamation of June 13, 1956, the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the Sixth Protocol of Supplementary Concessions to the General Agreement (TIAS 3591), including a schedule of United States concessions (hereinafter referred to as "Schedule XX (Geneva-1956)");
13. 
Whereas
 the third sub-classification of the description in item 1513 [second] in Part I of Schedule XX (Geneva-1956) erroneously reads "Figures or images of animate objects not specified above in this item" in place of "Figures or images animate objects wholly or in chief value of metal and not specified above in this item"; and
14. 
Whereas
 in the said proclamation of May 16, 1957, the rate of duty in the item set forth in the eighth recital should be "671'-,e per 100 lb." in place of the rate of "671 c' per lb.", the reference in Part II should be to the "sixteenth recital" of the said proclamation of June 13, 1956, in place of the reference to the "thirteenth recital" of that proclamation, and the reference in Part III should be to the "sixteenth recital" of Proclamation No. 3105 of July 22, 1955 (69 Stat. C44) in place of the reference to the "thirteenth recital" of that proclamation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
