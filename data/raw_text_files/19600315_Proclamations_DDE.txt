By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our life as a Nation is founded upon the Constitution of the United States, the oldest and most tested written constitution in the world; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that our citizens, both native-born and naturalized, observe the birthday of the Constitution and reaffirm their determination to support its principles, which have a universal appeal and application and are an inspiration to freedom-loving people everywhere; and
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 MI Stat. 9), the Congress designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of those citizens who have come of age and those who have been naturalized during the year; and
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved August 2, 1958 (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week, a time for study and observance of the acts which resulted in the formation of the Constitution; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid resolutions of the Congress authorize the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day and Constitution Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 19130; and I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies on that day designed to give our people a clearer understanding of their rights, responsibilities, and opportunities as citizens of the United States.
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1980, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches and in other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifteenth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
