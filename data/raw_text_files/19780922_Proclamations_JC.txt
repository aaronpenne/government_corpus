By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As our Nation struggles to build friendship among the peoples of this world, we are mindful that the noblest human concern is concern for others. 
Understanding, love, and respect build cohesive families and communities. The same bonds cement our Nation, and the nations of the world. 
For most of us, this sense of community is nurtured and expressed in our neighborhoods where we give each other an opportunity to share and feel part of a larger family. 
In recognition of the importance of fostering compassion and respect in ourselves for our neighbors, the Congress has requested the proclamation of September 24, 1978, as National Good Neighbor Day (S.J. Res. 133). 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, September 24, 1978, as National Good Neighbor Day. 
I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third. 
JIMMY CARTER
