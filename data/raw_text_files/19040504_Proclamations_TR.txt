By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 The Yellowstone Forest Reserve, in the States of Wyoming and Montana, was established by proclamation, dated January twenty-ninth, one thousand nine hundred and three, under the provisions of the act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws and for other purposes", and the act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes";
And Whereas,
 it is provided by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, that "The President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve";
And Whereas,
 the public lands in the States of Wyoming and Montana, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-Seven, do hereby make known and proclaim that the boundary lines of the aforesaid Yellowstone Forest Reserve are hereby modified so as to read as follows:
