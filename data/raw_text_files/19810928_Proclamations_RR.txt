By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Every year this Nation experiences needless loss of life and property. America's fire losses are a great waste of our precious resources and must be minimized. Destruction of property and what we pay for fire protection totals over $21 billion each year. But even worse, 7,500 American deaths annually can be attributed to fire. 
With a concerted effort by individual citizens, our Nation can curtail its needless fire losses. 
Installing and properly maintaining smoke detectors and practicing fire escape plans can reduce loss of life and property. If each of us would take a few simple precautions, fewer Americans would suffer disfigurement, the agony of injury, or the mental anguish of the sudden loss of loved ones. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do designate the week of October 4 through October 10, 1981, as Fire Prevention Week. 
Furthermore, I congratulate the fire service for their fire prevention efforts and support their continued work. The National Fire Protection Association, the Fire Marshals Association of North America, fire chiefs, and fire fighters deserve our thanks for their sponsorship of this year's fire safety observance. 
I direct the Federal Emergency Management Agency to work with all levels of government, industry, service organizations and volunteers to encourage the broadest possible use of smoke detectors across the Nation. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of Sept., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
