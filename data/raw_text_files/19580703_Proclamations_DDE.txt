A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 of all the days in the year, the primary one to us—as a Nation—is the 4th of July, the anniversary of the signing of our Declaration of Independence; and
Whereas
 on this day we renew our allegiance to the Union, to the principles of self-government, and to the spirit of freedom which is the source of its strength, deeply aware that in many quarters of the globe this freedom is now threatened as never before; and
Whereas
 the freedom of mankind is indivisible and our land must play a central part in defending and developing the wellsprings of freedom, not only for ourselves, but for our friends and allies; and
Whereas
 this is the year which marks the hundredth anniversary of the birth of Theodore Roosevelt, a champion of the highest ideals of American citizenship; and
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved July 3, 1958 (S. J. Res. 159) the Congress authorized and requested the President to proclaim July 4, 1958 as a day of rededication to the responsibilities of free citizenship:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, confident that July 4th will be observed as an occasion for traditional ceremony and civic festivities, call upon the people of the United States to observe this day as the beginning of a national year of dedication to the goals of free men. Let us use our liberty with honor and purpose, sharing it with our fellow citizens and, as free and responsible Americans, building a just and peaceful world for our children here at home and for our neighbors around the world.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
