By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
During wartime and peacetime American women in every branch of the Armed Forces have defended our country and our ideals with devotion and distinction. Such service, of course, is neither easy nor without risk. As veterans, these women continue to contribute to our Nation in civilian life. The week in which Veterans Day falls is a most appropriate time to offer women veterans our heartfelt respect and thanks for their part in preserving our freedom and security. 
This week we also remember that our gratitude as a Nation must include meeting women veterans' special needs and concerns. With the help of its Advisory Committee on Women Veterans, the Veterans' Administration has sought creative, effective ways to do this. National Women Veterans Recognition Week is a fine time to both redouble our efforts and express our appreciation. 
To create greater public awareness and recognition of the many achievements of women veterans, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 171, has designated the week beginning November 8, 1987, as "National Women Veterans Recognition Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 8, 1987, as National Women Veterans Recognition Week. I encourage all Americans and government officials at every level to celebrate this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of Nov., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
