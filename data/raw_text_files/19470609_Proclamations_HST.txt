By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933 as amended by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 750, 773, as amended by section 5 of the act of February 29, 1936, 49 Stat. 1148, 1152, and as reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246 (7 U.S.C. 624), the President issued a proclamation on September 5, 1939 (No. 2351, 54 Stat. 2640), limiting the quantities of certain cotton and cotton waste which might be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption, which proclamation was suspended in part or modified by the President's proclamations of December 19, 1940 (No. 2450, 54 Stat. 2769), March 31, 1942 (No. 2544, 56 Stat. 1944), June 29, 1942 (No. 2560, 56 Stat. 1963), and February 1, 1947 (No. 2715), and
Whereas
 the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, provides that the total quantity of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more in length which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any year commencing September 20 shall not exceed 45,656,420 pounds; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid limitation on the entry of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more in length was imposed after a finding by the President, on the basis of the investigation and report of the United States Tariff Commission made under the provisions of the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, that such cotton was being imported into the United States under such conditions and in sufficient quantities as to tend to render ineffective or materially interfere with the program undertaken with respect to cotton under the Soil Conservation and Domestic Allotment Act, as amended; and
Whereas
 the imposition of the aforesaid annual quotas on cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more in length was recommended by the United States Tariff Commission in its report (Report No. 137, 2d Series) in connection with which it was stated, in finding No. 5, that the quotas recommended "will prevent imports from interfering with the cotton program and at the same time will permit American industry to secure needed supplies of specialized types of cotton"; and
Whereas
 the total quantity of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more but less than 1 11/16 inches in length which may be entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption under the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, as modified, during the quota year ending September 19, 1947, has already been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption; and
Whereas
 pursuant to the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as further amended by the act of January 25, 1940, 54 Stat. 17, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplementary investigation to determine whether changed circumstances require the modification of the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so far as it limits the quantity of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more in length which may be entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption during the quota year ending September 19, 1947, particularly with reference to the possible need for an increase in the quota for the said quota year, in order to meet the current requirements of domestic manufacturers for long-staple cotton; and
Whereas
 in the course of the investigation, after due notice, a public hearing was held on February 18, 1947, at which parties interested were given opportunity to be present, to produce evidence, and to be heard, and, in addition to the hearing, the Commission made such investigation as it deemed necessary for a full disclosure and presentation of the facts; and
Whereas
 the Commission has made findings of fact and has transmitted to me a report of such findings and its recommendations based thereon, together with a transcript of the evidence submitted at the hearing, and has also transmitted a copy of such report to the Secretary of Agriculture; and
Whereas
 the Commission has recommended that an additional quantity of 23,094,000 pounds of cotton having a staple of 1 3/8 inches or more but less than 1 11/16 inches in length be permitted entry during the quota year ending September 19, 1947, in order to enable domestic users to obtain their essential requirements for such cotton;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby find and declare, on the basis of the investigation and report of the United States Tariff Commission, that changed circumstances require the modification of the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so as to permit the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, during the quota year ending September 19, 1947, of 23,094,000 pounds of cotton having a staple of 1 3/8 inches or more but less than 1 11/16 inches in length, in addition to the quantity of cotton having a staple of 1 1/8 inches or more but less than 1 11/16 inches in length the entry of which has already been made under the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, during the said quota year, which additional quantity I find should be permitted entry to carry out the purposes of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended. Accordingly, pursuant to the said section 11 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, I hereby modify the said proclamation of September 5, 1939, so as to permit during the quota year ending September 19, 1947, the entry for consumption, or withdrawal from warehouse for consumption, of an additional quantity of 23,094,000 pounds of cotton having a staple of 1 3/8 inches or more but less than 1 11/16 inches in length, which additional quantity I hereby find and declare may be entered for consumption, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, during such quota year without rendering or tending to render ineffective or materially interfering with the domestic program undertaken with respect to cotton, or reducing substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from cotton produced in the United States.
This proclamation shall become effective on the fifth day after the date of its signature.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first.
