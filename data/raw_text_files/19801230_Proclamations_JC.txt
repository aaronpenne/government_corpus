By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Import limitations have been imposed on certain cheeses pursuant to the provisions of Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, 7 U.S.C. 624. Section 701 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, P.L. 96-39 (the "Act"), requires that the President proclaim limitations on the quantity of cheese of the types specified therein, which may enter the United States in any calendar year after 1979. The Act provides that the annual aggregate quantity of such types of cheese entered shall not exceed 111,000 metric tons. Such quantitative limitations appear in Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202). The present limitations became effective on January 1, 1980, pursuant to Proclamation 4708 of December 11, 1979. 
2. In order to permit imports at a level more nearly in line with current trade requirements, the quantitative limitations set forth in the Appendix to the TSUS must be modified. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including the provisions of Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, and the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, do hereby proclaim that Part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is modified effective January 1, 1981, as set forth in the Annex to this Proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth. 
JIMMY CARTER
