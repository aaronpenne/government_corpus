By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Military Selective Service Act of 1967 (62 Stat. 604, as amended), I hereby prescribe the following amendment of the Selective Service Regulations prescribed by Executive Orders No. 10001 of September 17, 1948; No. 10735 of October 17, 1957; No. 11360 of June 30, 1967; No. 11497 of November 26, 1969; and constituting portions of Chapter XVI of Title 32 of the Code of Federal Regulations:
Paragraph (d) of Section 1631.5, Calls by the Director of Selective Service, is amended to read as follows:
"(d) The Director of Selective Service shall establish a random selection sequence for induction. Such random selection sequence will be established by a drawing to be conducted in Washington, D.C., once each year on a date the Director shall fix, and shall be applied nationwide. The random selection method shall use 365 days or, when appropriate, 366 days to represent the birthdays (month and day only) of all registrants who, during the calendar year within which occurs the date fixed for the drawing, shall have attained their nineteenth but not their twentieth year of age. The drawing, commencing with the first day selected and continuing until all 365 days or, when appropriate, 366 days are drawn, shall be accomplished impartially. The random selection sequence thus obtained shall, in accordance with the Selective Service Regulations, determine the order of selection of such registrants. The random sequence number thus determined for any registrant shall apply to him so long as he remains subject to induction for military training and service by random selection. A random sequence number established for a registrant shall be equivalent, for purposes of selection, to the same random sequence number established for other registrants in other drawings, including the drawings of December 1, 1969 and of July 1, 1970, and the random selection sequences obtained in those drawings shall continue to determine the order of selection of the registrants covered thereby in accordance with the Selective Service Regulations. Selection among registrants who have the same random sequence number shall be based upon the supplemental drawing conducted December 1, 1969, which determined alphabetically a random selection sequence by name."
