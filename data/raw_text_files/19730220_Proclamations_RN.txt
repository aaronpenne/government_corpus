A Proclamation
 
Pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1351), and section 201 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821) (hereinafter "TEA"), the President, by Proclamation No. 2929 of June 2, 1951, No. 3140 of June 13, 1956, and No. 3822 of December 16, 1967 (65 Stat. c12, 70 Stat. c33, and 82 Stat. 1455), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties as were found to be required or appropriate to carry out trade agreements into which he had entered;
Among the proclaimed modifications were modifications in the rate of duty on pianos which were provided for in item 725.02 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) (hereinafter "TSUS");
Pursuant to sections 201(a) (2) and 351(a) (1) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2), 19 U.S.C. 1981(a) (1)), and in accordance with section 253 (d) of said Act (19 U.S.C. 1883(d)), and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58, 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), the President by Proclamation No. 3964 of February 21, 1970 (84 Stat. 2212) proclaimed two new items in the TSUS for pianos, including item 725.01 applicable to pianos, except grand pianos, and also proclaimed increased duties on imports of such pianos in item 924.00 of Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS, which increased duties are scheduled to terminate on February 21, 1973;
In accordance with section 351(c) (2) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1981(c) (2)), after taking into account advice received from the Tariff Commission under section 351(d) (3) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1981 (d) (3)) and after seeking advice of the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, I have determined that the extension as hereinafter proclaimed of the increased duties currently in effect on imports of pianos, except grand pianos, provided for in item 924.00 of the TSUS from February 21, 1973 to February 20, 1974, is in the national interest;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including sections 201(a) (2) and 351(c) (2) of the Trade Expansion Act, and in accordance with section 253(d) of said Act and Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, do proclaim thatâ€”(1) The column numbered 1 rates of duty provided for in TSUS item 725.01 by Proclamation 3822, as modified by paragraph 2 (b) of Proclamation 3964, are hereby further modified to read as follows:
(2) The increased rate of duty on imports of pianos provided for in item 924.00 of Subpart A to Part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is extended to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on and after February 21, 1973, and before the close of February 20, 1974.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-seventh.
