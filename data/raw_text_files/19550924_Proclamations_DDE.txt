A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski, a Polish patriot, came as a young man to the United States and proffered his services to the Revolutionary forces, bringing, as he himself declared, nothing but the integrity of his heart and the fervency of his zeal; and
Whereas
 he earned the commission of brigadier general in the Continental Army, contributed nobly to the cause of American independence, and gave his life for that cause on October 11, 1779, when he died of a wound inflicted two days earlier while he was leading a cavalry attack on Savannah during the siege of that city; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that in recognition of his inspiring courage and transcendent love of liberty we should pay public tribute to Casimir Pulaski on the one hundred and seventy-sixth anniversary of his death:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Tuesday, the eleventh day of October, 1955, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite all our people to observe that day with ceremonies commemorative of General Pulaski's supreme sacrifice for freedom's sake.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
