A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617) authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 children are our Nation's richest resource and our most welcome responsibility; and
Whereas
 home life that is satisfying physically, emotionally, and spiritually is essential to the development of healthy personality in children; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day is a suitable occasion for emphasizing the fundamental importance to our Nation of wholesome family life:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the first day of May, 1954, as Child Health Day; and I urge all families to make this a day when parents and children join in family activity of work or play that will strengthen and enrich the union between them. I also invite all organizations and groups interested in child welfare to unite upon that day in observances designed to enhance family ties throughout the year.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 17th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy eighth.
