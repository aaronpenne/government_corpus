By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The hope, the courage, and the faith that guide us through all our lives are priceless gifts that go back in time beyond our first recollections. They were given us by our mothers and enriched with each passing year.
To the extent that each of us makes use of these gifts, our adult lives will reflect our faith, our compassion, and our strength to meet our problems and obligations, and to deal with them wisely and justly in the finest traditions of our national character. Thus the training and love that we receive from our mothers play mighty roles in determining the quality of our adult livesâ€”individually, and as a Nation.
Once each year, our Nation sets aside a special day to pay tribute to our mothers. This day, pursuant to a joint resolution of the Congress approved on May 8, 1914, falls each year on the second Sunday of May.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 12, 1968, be observed as Mother's Day, and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
Let us pay a special tribute to those courageous mothers of our gallant fighting men on the battlefields of Vietnam. Let us honor both mother and son for their personal commitment to honor and duty that reflects the Nation's dedication to a search for a lasting peace.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of April, in the year of our Lord ninteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of American the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
