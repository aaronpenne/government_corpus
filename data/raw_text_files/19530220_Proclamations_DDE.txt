A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 the health and wholesome development of our children are matters of the deepest concern to all Americans; and
Whereas
 the stresses and strains of our times create many problems bearing on the spiritual and emotional health of our children and are reflected notably in Juvenile delinquency; and
Whereas
 we have made tremendous advances in overcoming the most severe physical hazards of childhood, and are now striving to make equally significant progress in understanding the nature of emotional health, in order that our children may grow into mature, responsible citizens of a democracy:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America. do hereby designate the first day of May, 1953, as Child Health Day; and I urge all parents and young people, and all other individuals, as well as agencies and organizations interested in the well-being of children, to increase their understanding of the emotional, social, and spiritual growth of children, so as to apply this understanding in their day-to-day relations with the rising generation.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 20th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
