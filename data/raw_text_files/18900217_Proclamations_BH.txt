A Proclamation
 
Whereas that portion of the Indian Territory commonly known as the Cherokee Strip or Outlet has been for some years in the occupancy of an association or associations of white persons under certain contracts said to have been made with the Cherokee Nation, in the nature of a lease or leases for grazing purposes; and
Whereas an opinion has been given to me by the Attorney-General, concurring with the opinion given to my predecessor by the late Attorney-General, that whatever the right or title of said Cherokee Nation or of the United States to or in said lands may be, no right exists in said Cherokee Nation under the statutes of the United States to make such leases or grazing contracts, and that such contracts are wholly illegal and void; and
Whereas the continued use of said lands thereunder for grazing purposes is prejudicial to the public interests:
Now, therefore, I, Benjamin Harrison, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and give notice--
First. That no cattle or live stock shall hereafter be brought upon said lands for herding or grazing thereon.
Second. That all cattle and other live stock now on said outlet must be removed therefrom not later than October 2, 1890, and so much sooner as said lands or any of them may be or become lawfully open to settlement by citizens of the United States; and that all persons connected with said cattle companies or associations must, not later than the time above indicated, depart from said lands.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 17th day of February, A. D. 1890, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fourteenth.
By the President:
BENJ. HARRISON

JAMES G. BLAINE,
