A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 equal opportunity for employment is basic to our belief in human dignity and should never be denied any qualified person because of physical impairment; and
Whereas
 our expanding economy requires more workers, the useful employment of all who are able and willing to work; and
Whereas
 the physically handicapped, with the aid of expanded rehabilitation and training programs, are able to perform many of the skilled and demanding tasks essential to our social and economic progress; and
Whereas
 the full use of this source of manpower depends upon better understanding on the part of employers, fellow employees and all our citizens across the land; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 6, 1957, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week. I also urge our citizens to remember, throughout the year, that by their interest and efforts many handicapped persons can be assisted to economic Independence and active participation in our productive way of life.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
