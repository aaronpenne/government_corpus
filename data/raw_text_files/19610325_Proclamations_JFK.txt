A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 cancer strikes in approximately two of three American families and seriously affects the vitality of our Nation; and 
Whereas
 the one million Americans who have been saved from cancer are living testimony to the success of control methods produced over decades of arduous and painstaking research; and 
Whereas
 it is clear to all who battle this disease that the solution of the problem of cancer will be achieved only by full application of control measures now known and of those yet to be developed; and 
Whereas
 it is essential to the health of the Nation that our citizens be aware of the extensive efforts directed toward the control of cancer in order to avail themselves of these measures; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1961 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
I also request the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all interested persons and groups to unite during the designated month in public reaffirmation of this Nation's effort to control the disease of cancer. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fifth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
