By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes, and as President of the United States, it is ordered that paragraph 3 (a) of Executive Order No. 9721 of May 10, 1946, providing for the transfer of personnel to public international organizations in which the United States Government participates, be, and it is hereby, modified as follows:
The provision which requires that service in the public international organization to which the employee is transferred shall be terminated within three years from the date of such transfer to entitle the employee to the reemployment rights conferred by the said paragraph is modified so that Gerald C. Gross, a former employee of the Federal Communications Commission who is now employed by the International Telecommunication Union, is terminated without prejudice within five years from the date of the beginning of his service with such Union; provided that he complies with all other provisions of the said Executive order with respect to such reemployment.
