Whereas the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America, in Congress assembled, have declared that a state of war exists between the United States and the Imperial German Government; and 
Whereas it is necessary to operate certain radio stations for radio communication by the Government and to close other radio stations not so operated, to insure the proper conduct of the war against the Imperial German Government and the successful termination thereof. 
Now, therefore, it is ordered by virtue of authority vested in me under the Constitution under the Joint Resolution of Congress, dated April 6, 1917, and under the Act to Regulate Radio Communication, approved August 13, 1912, that such radio stations within the jurisdiction of the United States as are required for Naval Communications shall be taken over by the Government of the United States and used and controlled by it, to the exclusion of any other control or use; and furthermore, that all radio stations not necessary to the Government of the United States for Naval Communications may be closed for radio communication and all radio apparatus therein may be removed therefrom. 
The enforcement of this order is hereby delegated to the Secretary of the Navy, who is authorized and directed to take such action in the premises as to him may appear necessary. 
This order shall take effect from and after this date.
