By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As a special mark of respect to the memory of the Honorable Hubert H. Humphrey, former Vice President of the United States of America and Senator from the State of Minnesota, I, Jimmy Carter, President of the United States of America do hereby proclaim, by virtue of the authority vested in me by a Joint Resolution of the Congress (36 U.S.C. 178), that the period of public tribute and appreciation shall be extended and the flag of the United States shall be flown at halfstaff on all buildings, grounds, and naval vessels of the Federal government in the District of Columbia, and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until, and including January 19, 1978, the day the 95th Congress of the United States reconvenes. 
I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
May this period, as Senator Humphrey wished, "be a time to celebrate life and the future" even though we cannot escape the pain and sorrow of his leaving. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second. 
JIMMY CARTER
