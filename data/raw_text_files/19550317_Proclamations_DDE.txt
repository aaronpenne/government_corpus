A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 accidents kill more than fourteen thousand, and injure more than one million, farm residents each year; and
Whereas
 human failure is associated with nearly all these deaths and disabling injuries; and
Whereas
 the occupational death rate of the nearly seven million farm workers in the United States is the third highest among the rates reported for all types of industry in this country; and
Whereas
 every farm worker can aid in reducing the toll of deaths and injuries by constantly bearing in mind the slogan, "Your safety is in your hands":
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 24, 1955, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urgently request all farm workers to make safety inventories of their homes, farms, machinery, and equipment, and to cultivate careful work habits and attitudes. I also request all persons and organizations interested in farm life and welfare to join in a campaign to reduce the tragedies and losses caused by needless accidents.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 17th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
HERBERT HOOVER, Jr.,
Acting Secretary of State
