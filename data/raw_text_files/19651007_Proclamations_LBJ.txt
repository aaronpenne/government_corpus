A Proclamation
 
On the streets and highways of our nation, the white cane instantly identifies the blind person, proudly coming and going on his own, but highly dependent for safety upon the courtesy and consideration of others. To make our people more fully aware of the significance of the white cane, and of the need for motorists to exercise caution and courtesy when approaching persons carrying a white cane, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 6, 1964 (78 Stat. 1003), has authorized the President to proclaim October 15 of each year as White Cane Safety Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 15, 1965, as White Cane Safety Day.
I urge civic and service organizations, schools, public bodies, and the media of public information in every community to join in observing White Cane Safety Day with activities which will promote greater awareness of the meaning of the white cane, and thus contribute to the safety of our blind citizens.
I call upon all our citizens to join individually in this effort, that blind persons in our society may continue to enjoy a high degree of independence.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

GEORGE W. BALL
