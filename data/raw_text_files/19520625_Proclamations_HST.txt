A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the import duties imposed under paragraphs 391 and 392 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, on lead-bearing ores, flue dust, and mattes of all kinds, lead bullion or base bullion, lead in pigs and bars, lead dross, reclaimed lead, scrap lead, antimonial lead, and antimonial scrap lead have been suspended by Public Law 257, 82d Congress, approved February 11, 1952, with respect to imports entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period beginning February 12, 1952, and ending with the close of March 31, 1953, or the termination of the national emergency proclaimed by me on December 16, 1950, whichever is earlier;
Whereas
 the said Public Law 257 contains the following proviso:
Provided, That when, for any one calendar month during such period [of suspended duties], the average market price of common lead for that month, in standard shapes and sizes, delivered at New York, has been below 18 cents per pound, the Tariff Commission, within fifteen days after the conclusion of such calendar month, shall so advise the President, and the President shall, by proclamation, not later than twenty days after he has been so advised by the Tariff Commission, revoke such suspension of the duties imposed under paragraphs 391 and 392 of the Tariff Act of 1930, such revocation to be effective with respect to articles entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after the date of such proclamation;
Whereas
, on the fifth day of June, 1952, the Tariff Commission reported to me that it has found that the average market price of common lead for the month of May 1952, in standard shapes and sizes, delivered at New York, has been below 18 cents per pound:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to the said proviso of Public Law 257, 82d Congress, do hereby proclaim the revocation of the suspension of duties provided for in the said Public Law 257, such revocation to be effective with respect to articles entered for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption after the date of this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
