A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the growth, prosperity, and well-being of our country depend primarily on an alert, enlightened, and faithful citizenry; and
Whereas
 the strength of our nation lies in the unity of all our people, of whatever race, creed, culture, or national origin - a unity that can be built only upon full realization of the worth and meaning of American citizenship; and
Whereas
 it is necessary for each citizen, native-born and foreign-born alike, to meet his responsibilities of citizenship with intelligence, courage, and unselfish devotion to the principles upon which this Nation is founded:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Congress by Public Resolution 67, approved May 3, 1940, do hereby designate Sunday, May 15, 1949, as "I Am An American Day," and do set aside that day as a public occasion for the special recognition of those of our youth who have become of age and to those foreign-born who have been naturalized during the past year. And I urge all Americans on that day to reaffirm their faith in the principles and ideals to which this nation is dedicated and more firmly resolve to discharge in full the solemn obligations of their citizenship.
I call upon Federal, State, and local officials, as well as patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, to conduct exercises on or about May 15 in which all our people may join with those who have newly assumed the responsibilities of American citizenship in dedicating themselves to the pursuit of peace, security, and happiness for Americans and for people everywhere.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 10th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
