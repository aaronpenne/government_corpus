A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our mothers are enshrined in our hearts as symbols of those high ideals which have fostered our growth as a great Nation; and
Whereas
 we are wont to unite on one day each year in paying special tribute to our mothers, whose love and care and teaching have guided us in youth and blessed us in maturity; and
Whereas
 the Congress gave formal recognition to that custom by a Joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), which set aside the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 9, 1954, be observed as Mother's Day; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also call upon the people generally to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places, as an expression of love for their own mothers and reverence for the mothers of our country.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 29th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
WALTER B. SMITH,
Acting Secretary of State
