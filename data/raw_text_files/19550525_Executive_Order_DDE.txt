By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 4 of the act of June 4, 1954, 68 Stat. 176, I hereby prescribe the following regulations governing the payment of general-average contributions in connection with the transportation of certain baggage and household goods and effects of military and civilian personnel of the United States:
SECTION 1. Definitions. As used in these regulations:
(a) The term "military personnel" means members and former and deceased members of the uniformed services as defined in section 102 of the Career Compensation Act of 1949 (63 Stat. 804).
(b) The term "civilian employees" means civilian officers and employees of a department, including Foreign Service personnel, and former and deceased civilian officers and employees.
(c) The terms "military personnel" and "civilian employees" shall also include those individuals enumerated under the term "person" as defined in section 1 of the Missing Persons Act, as amended (50 U.S.C. App. 1001) .
(d) The term "department" means an executive department, independent establishment, or other agency of the Federal Government, including wholly-owned or controlled Government corporations.
(e) The term "general-average contribution" means the contribution by all parties to a sea venture (1) to make good the loss sustained by any one of their number on account of voluntary sacrifices made of part of the ship or cargo to save the residue or the lives of those on board from impending peril, or (2) for extraordinary expenses necessarily incurred for the common benefit and safety of all.
(1) The term "household goods" means such baggage, household goods, and effects, including privately-owned automobiles and professional books, papers, and equipment, of military personnel and civilian employees as are authorized to be transported at Government expense by law or regulation pursuant to law.
SEC. 2. Allowance of general-average contributions. Whenever military personnel or civilian employees of a department are liable for general-average contributions arising out of shipments of household goods (as defined in section 1 (f) hereof), authorized or approved under law or regulations pursuant to law, disbursements shall be made, under rules and regulations prescribed by the head of the department concerned, from appropriations chargeable for the transportation of baggage and household goods and effects (a) for the payment of the general-average contributions for which such military personnel or civilian employees are liable, or (b) for the reimbursement of such military personnel or civilian employees in the amounts of their general-average liability paid by them and for which receipts are furnished, subject to the limitations set forth in section 3 hereof.
SEC. 3. Limitations. The provisions of section 2 hereof shall not apply:
(a) In case the shipment of household goods is made under law or regulation pursuant to law which provides for reimbursement to the military person or civilian employee concerned on a commuted basis in lieu of payment by the Government of the actual costs of the shipment; or
(b) In case the military person or civilian employee concerned has himself selected the means of shipment; or
(c) To quantities of household goods (excluding automobiles) shipped in excess of quantities authorized to be transported by law or regulation pursuant to law. In any case of such excess shipment, the liability of the Government for the employee's general-average contribution shall not exceed the proportion that the applicable limitation, by weight or volume, bears to the total quantity, by weight or volume, of the household goods shipped.
SEC. 4. Effective date. This order shall be effective in any case in which the loss involved occurs, or has occurred, on or after June 4, 1954.
