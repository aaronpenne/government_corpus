A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 by Executive Order of June 22, 1892, certain lands in Sections nine and sixteen, Township five South, Range Eight-east, Gila and Salt River Base and Meridian in the Territory of Arizona, were withdrawn under the Act of Congress approved March 2, 1889, entitled, "An Act to make appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirty, eighteen hundred and ninety, and for other purposes," and it appears that the land located in said Section nine does not contain any of said Ruin, and that the additional land in said Section sixteen contains a part of said Ruin and should be reserved for the protection thereof; 
Now, Therefore, I, William H. Taft,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by said Act of March 2, 1889, do restore to the public domain the southwest quarter of the southeast quarter and the south half of the southwest quarter of said Section nine, and do hereby reserve from appropriation and use of all kinds under the public land laws, subject to any valid adverse claims, the north half, the north half of southwest quarter and the north half of the southeast quarter of said Section sixteen, as shown upon the diagram hereto attached and made a part of this proclamation. 
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to excavate, appropriate, injure or destroy any of the objects hereby reserved, nor to settle upon any of the lands contained within the boundaries of this reservation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the city of Washington this 10th day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and nine, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-fourth.
