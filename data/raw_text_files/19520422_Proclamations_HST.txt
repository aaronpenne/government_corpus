A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 American mothers, who helped to settle our Nation and to blaze pioneer trails across it, have ever stood as symbols of benevolence, virtue, and idealism; and
Whereas
, we are wont to set aside a day each year for special expressions of love and reverence for our mothers and of appreciation for the training and care with which they have enriched our lives; and
Whereas
, in official acknowledgement of the paramount place that mothers hold in our history as well as in our hearts, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the celebration of the second Sunday in May as Mother's Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request the observance of Sunday, May 11, 1952, as Mother's Day, and I call upon the appropriate officials to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, and upon the people of the nation to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places, on the appointed day. Let us all on that day, through prayer and through renewed expressions of our love and respect, pay honor to our mothers and to the ideals which they have taught us.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 22nd day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
