By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Proclamation No. 4663 of May 24, 1979, modified Headnote 3 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.G. 1202), authorizing the Secretary of State to allocate the sugar import quota among supplying countries or areas to the extent necessary to conform with the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, which the United States then was applying provisionally. 
2. The United States signed the International Sugar Agreement on January 2, 1980. The International Sugar Agreement 1977, Implementation Act (P.L. 96-236; 94 Stat. 336) (the Act) enacted on April 22, 1980, authorized full implementation of United States rights and obligations under that agreement.
3. In order to carry out and enforce the International Sugar Agreement, the Act authorizes the President to limit the entry into the United States of sugar, as defined in the Agreement, which is the product of foreign countries, territories or areas not members of the International Sugar Agreement, to take other action and to issue and enforce rules and regulations necessary or appropriate to enforce U.S. rights and obligations under the Agreement. The President also is authorized to designate agencies or Offices of the United States which will exercise the powers and functions conferred by the Act. 
4. Reorganization Plan Number 3 of 1979, transferred to the United States Trade Representative the functions of the Secretary of State with respect to commodity agreements. Executive Order No. 12224 of July 1, 1980, delegated the powers and duties of the President to the United States Trade Representative. 
5. To reflect the developments described in paragraphs 2, 3, and 4, Proclamation 4663 must be amended. The actions proclaimed below conform with the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, and give due consideration, as required by Headnote 2, of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the TSUS, to the interests of domestic producers of sugar in the United States and of affected contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including the International Sugar Agreement 1977, Implementation Act (P.L. 96-236; 94 Stat. 336) and in conformity with Headnote 2 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of TSUS, do hereby proclaim: 
(1) The first paragraph of Headnote 3 of Subpart A, Part 10, Schedule 1 of the TSUS is modified by substituting for the second and third sentences of that paragraph the following: 
"The U.S. Trade Representative or his designee may allocate this quantity among supplying countries or areas, and may prescribe further rules, regulations, limitations or prohibitions on the entry of sugar in accordance with the International Sugar Agreement, 1977, and Public Law 96-236. The U.S. Trade Representative or his designee shall inform the Commissioner of Customs of any such action regarding the importation of sugar, and shall publish notice thereof in the FEDERAL REGISTER". 
(2) The provisions of this proclamation are effective July 1, 1980. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
