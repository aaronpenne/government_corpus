By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
More than sixty years ago, the Jaycee idea began in St. Louis, Missouri. Today there are more than three hundred thousand members in 8,318 chapters across the country. 
Over the years, the Jaycees have worked to meet the vital needs of our ever-changing and increasingly complex society. Motivated by their creed, "Service to humanity is the best work of life," hundreds of thousands of Jaycees have reached out to their fellow citizens in need and, in the process, have enriched their own lives. 
In recognition of the accomplishments of this unique organization, the Congress of the United States has, by Senate Joint Resolution 117 (P.L. 97-144), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week of January 17, 1982, through January 23, 1982, as "National Jaycee Week." 
Now, Therefore, I Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 17, 1982, as National Jaycee Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that period with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
