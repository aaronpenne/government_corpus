By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution, which gave women the right to vote, became law sixty-three years ago on August 26, 1920. 
Since that important milestone in the history of the United States, women have used the ballot just as they have always used their energies and talents—to affect and improve our national life. 
When the great philosopher and historian Alexis de Tocqueville visited America, he took a long look at our way of life and wrote, "If I were asked .... to what the singular prosperity and growing strength of that people ought mainly to be attributed, I should reply: To the superiority of their women." 
Women have every reason to be proud of their contributions to every aspect of our society—science, space, government, business, medicine, education, health, and the family. And their contributions are growing. 
We continue, as a Nation, to pursue equal opportunity and rights for all of our citizens, granting each person the chance to reach his or her goals. 
On this occasion, it is appropriate that we recognize the accomplishments of the women of America and renew our efforts to ensure equal opportunity for all people in this great land. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim August 26, 1983, as Women's Equality Day. I call upon all Americans and interested organizations to mark this occasion with appropriate observances. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 4th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
