By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Act approved May 22, 1918, entitled "An Act to Prevent in Time of War Departure from and Entry into the United States Contrary to the Public Safety," I, Warren G. Harding, President of the United States of America, hereby amend the Executive Order of August 8, 1918, relating to the "Rules and Regulations Governing the Issuance of Permits to Enter and Leave the United States," by the following provisions:
Aliens who are passengers on vessels calling, while en route to foreign destinations, at ports of the United States, including outlying territories and insular possessions, may be allowed to land at these ports without visaed passports, provided that they land merely for the limited periods of time during which the vessels may lie over at the ports mentioned, and provided also, that they continue their voyages on the same vessels. These exceptions are made for the benefit of passengers who desire to land temporarily for purposes of sightseeing or other legitimate objects. Aliens landing with the intention of remaining for a longer period are required to present visaed passports. It will be the duty of the masters of the vessels to satisfy the Immigration authorities that passengers who obtain permission to land temporarily will not remain on shore after the departure of the vessels. Appropriate instructions upon this subject will be sent by the Department of Labor to Immigration officials at seaports. The names of all passengers of the class mentioned who fail to reimbark and continue their voyages shall be reported by the Immigration authorities at the ports to the Department of Labor and the Department of State, for appropriate action.
WARREN G. HARDING
THE WHITE HOUSE, May 12, 1921.
