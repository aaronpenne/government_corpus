A Proclamation
The Convention on the International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea, 1972, 28 U.S.T. 3459 (the "Convention"), was signed at London on October 20, 1972, was proclaimed by the President of the United States on January 19, 1977, and entered into force for the United States on July 15, 1977. 
The International Maritime Organization, in accordance with Article VI of the Convention, by its resolution A. 464 (XII), at London on November 19, 1981, adopted amendments to the Convention. The amendments, which entered into force for the Contracting Parties on June 1, 1983, relax lighting requirements for smaller vessels and clarify the language of the existing regulations. A copy of the amendments, as corrected by a proces-verbal of rectification, is annexed to this Proclamation and made a part hereof. 
On January 27, 1983, these amendments were transmitted to the Congress of the United States, consistent with section 3(d) of the International Navigational Rules Act of 1977 (91 Stat. 308; 33 U.S.C. 1602). 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 3(d) of the International Navigational Rules Act of 1977, do hereby declare and proclaim that these amendments to the Convention shall be effective on and after June 1, 1983, for the United States of America, the citizens of the United States of America, and all other persons subject to the jurisdiction of the United States of America. 
In Witness Whereof, I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
