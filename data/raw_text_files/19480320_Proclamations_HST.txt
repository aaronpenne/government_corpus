A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Army of the United States is a mighty shield of our nation in war and the faithful servant of our people in time of peace; and 
Whereas
 the concept of a Western Hemisphere community of nations is expressed through the principles, agencies, and procedures of the Inter-American System, the foundations of which were laid at the First International Conference of American States in the year 1890; and
Whereas
 the Ninth International Conference of American States is soon to be held at Bogota, Colombia, to consolidate and strengthen the Inter-American System, in order that the common will of the American republics may be more perfectly realized, in consonance with the principles and purposes of the United Nations; and
Whereas
 the Governing Board of the Pan American Union has resolved that April 14, the founding date of the Union, should be officially observed each year by every member country as Pan American Day, a custom which the United States has followed:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, April 14, 1948, as Pan American Day, and in order to broaden the scope of the observance of this anniversary, I designate the week beginning April 11, 1948, as Pan American Week. I call upon the officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings during that week; and I invite the people of the several States, Territories, and possessions of the United States and the appropriate officials thereof, as well as the churches, schools, clubs, and other organizations of our country, to participate in the observance of Pan American Week with suitable commemorative displays, exhibits, and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 20th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
