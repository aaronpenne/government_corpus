A Proclamation
 
Steel is the core of industrial America. It has helped to make American productivity and technology the wonder of the world.
This vital product which we produce in unmatched abundance is basic to our economy and essential to our security. It supports our buildings, spans our rivers, arms our fighting men.
It is fundamental to thousands of products which are part of the everyday life of every citizen of this Nation.
It will be increasingly important to us in the years that lie ahead. Research continues to uncover new uses for this durable and versatile product to satisfy exacting military and civilian requirements.
Moreover, the steel industry makes its own vital contribution to the American economy with its demand for raw materials, equipment, and the services of other industries.
The steel industry has created a distinctive symbol for its productsâ€”the "steelmark." It is used to identify products made of steel and to increase public awareness of the importance of steel to our national life.
By a joint resolution approved November 2, 1966, the Congress designated the month of May of each year as Steelmark Month and requested the President to issue a proclamation for the observance of such a month.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all the people of the United States to observe the month of May in this and each succeeding year as Steelmark Month with appropriate proceedings and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
