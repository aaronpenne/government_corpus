WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between Swift and Company, Armour and Company, Wilson and Company, Cudahy Packing Company, Hygrade Food Products Corporation, and John Morrell and Company, and certain of their employees represented by the United Packinghouse Workers of America (C.I.O.) involving wages; and 
WHEREAS in my opinion such dispute threatens to result in a strike or lockout affecting a substantial part of the meat-packing industry, an industry engaged in trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in the production of goods for commerce, which strike or lock-out, if permitted to occur, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947 (Public Law 101 80th Congress), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before April 1, 1948.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
