"(11) He is a person who, immediately preceding the time of his application for admission into the United States, has been employed continuously for one year by a firm or corporation or other legal entity or an affiliate or subsidiary thereof and who seeks to enter the United States temporarily in order to continue to render his services to the same employer or a subsidiary or affiliate thereof in a capacity that is managerial, executive, or involves specialized knowledge, or is the spouse or minor child of any such person if accompanying him or following to join him."
Section 1611.2 is further amended by deleting the word "or" after the semicolon at the end of subparagraph (9) of paragraph (b) and by substituting, in lieu of the period at the end of subparagraph (10) of paragraph (b), a semicolon followed by the word "or".
