By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In an era when technological advancement has brought to our Nation an almost unbelievable array of conveniences and comforts, we still are plagued by the hazard of man's oldest implement for self-preservation--fire. The potential dangers associated with fire still present a real threat to human life and property.
The present level of our annual fire losses—more than 12,000 lives and over $2 billion in property—is a measure of our failure to heed fire hazards and to correct them. It is essential that every citizen recognize that such losses can be avoided, but only by personal involvement, determination, and a realization that fires need not occur.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 5, 1969, as Fire Prevention Week.
I urge that we, as a Nation and as individual citizens, assume a positive approach to fire prevention through the support of community fire departments, State and local governments, the National Fire Protection Association, business and civic groups, and public organizations that are trying to combat the senseless waste of human life and national resources.
I also urge Federal agencies, through the Federal Fire Council, to initiate and carry on effective fire prevention programs not only for the protection of Government employees and property but also for the betterment of all segments of our society.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
