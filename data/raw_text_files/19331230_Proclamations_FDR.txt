By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, on March 6, 1933, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, by virtue of authority vested in me by the act of October 6, 1917 (40 Stat. L. 411), as amended, issued a proclamation declaring that an emergency existed and that a national banking holiday be observed;
Whereas
, on March 9, 1933, I issued a proclamation continuing the terms and conditions of said proclamation of March 6, 1933, in full force and effect until further proclamation by the President;
Whereas
, on March 10, 1933, I issued an Executive Order authorizing the appropriate authority having immediate supervision of banking institutions in each State or any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to permit any banking institution not a member of the Federal Reserve System to perform any or all of its usual banking functions except as otherwise provided;
Whereas
, the Secretary of the Treasury, pursuant to authority granted by other provisions of the said Executive Order of March 10, 1933, has acted upon all requests for licensing of banks members of the Federal Reserve System;
Whereas
, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation has acted upon all applications to it for membership in the Temporary Federal Deposit Insurance Fund as provided for in section 12B (y) of the Federal Reserve Act as amended by section 8 of the act of June 16, 1933, Public No. 66, 73d Congress, and has admitted to the said fund all applicant banks which are duly and properly qualified; and
Whereas
, it is now appropriate that the banking authority in each State and any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States should have and exercise the sole responsibility for, and control over, banking institutions not members of the Federal Reserve System;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, in order to assure that the banking authority in each State and in any place subject to the jurisdiction of the United States shall have and exercise the sole responsibility for, and control over, banking institutions which are not members of the Federal Reserve System, do hereby proclaim, order, direct, and declare that the proclamations of March 6, 1933, and March 9, 1933, and the Executive Order of March 10, 1933, and all orders and regulations pursuant thereto, are amended, effective the first day of January, nineteen hundred and thirty-four, to exclude from their scope banking institutions which are not members of the Federal Reserve System. Provided, however, That no banking institution shall pay out any gold coin, gold bullion, or gold certificates, except as authorized by the Secretary of the Treasury, nor allow the withdrawal of any currency for hoarding, nor engage in any transactions in foreign exchange except such as may be undertaken for legitimate and normal business requirements, for reasonable traveling and other personal requirements, and for the fulfillment of contracts entered into prior to March 6, 1933.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
The White House,
December 30, 1933
