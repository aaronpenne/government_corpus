A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski, Polish patriot and officer of the American Revolutionary Army, fought for the independence of our Nation and for it laid down his life; and
Whereas
 Count Casimir Pulaski typifies the indomitable spirit which has sustained the Polish people through the perils of World War II and which has lent strength to the many thousands of devoted citizens of this country who look to Poland as an ancestral home; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved October 11, 1945 (Public Law 191, 79th Congress), the Congress has authorized and directed me "to issue a proclamation calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all governmental buildings on October 11, 1945, and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the death of General Casimir Pulaski":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon officials of the Government to have the flag of the United States displayed on all governmental buildings on October 11, 1945; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with commemorative ceremonies in honor of General Casimir Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 11th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth.
