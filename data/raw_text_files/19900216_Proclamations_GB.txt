A Proclamation
 
The personalized, cost-effective home care provided by Visiting Nurse Associations is a great blessing to thousands of Americans affected by illness, injury, or disability. Visiting Nurse Associations are voluntary, independently operated community organizations that offer a wide range of medical care and support services -- including specialized nursing services, physical and occupational therapy, nutritional counseling, and meals. Through Visiting Nurse Associations, qualified health care professionals and volunteers generously bring not only their knowledge and skills but also welcome companionship to homebound Americans in rural and urban communities. 
Home health services offer comfort and dignity to patients recovering from illness or injury, to persons incapacitated by mental or physical handicaps, to the terminally ill, and to those suffering from chronically disabling diseases. By rendering such services, Visiting Nurse Associations are making an important difference in the lives of individuals and families across the country. 
In recognition of the efforts of those dedicated and hardworking men and women who make the work of Visiting Nurse Associations possible, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 103, has designated the week beginning February 18, 1990, as "National Visiting Nurse Associations Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 18 through February 24, 1990, as National Visiting Nurse Associations Week. I urge all Americans to join me in observing this week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
