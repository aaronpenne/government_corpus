By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the act of February 8, 1887, ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389, by the act of June 21, 1906, ch. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 326, and by the act of March 2, 1917, ch. 146, 39 Stat. 969, 976, it is ordered that the periods of trust applying to any Indian lands, whether of a tribal or individual status, which, unless extended, will expire December 31, 1936, or during the calendar year 1937, be, and they are hereby, extended in each case for a further period of 25 years from the date on which any such trust would otherwise expire. 
This order is not intended to apply to any case in which Congress has specifically reserved to itself authority to extend the period of trust on tribal or individual Indian lands.
