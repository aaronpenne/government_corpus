The Civil Service Commission may, in its discretion, when it believes such action to be in the interest of the service, authorize the employment by the War Department, for such time as may be necessary during the period of the present war, of the inspection staffs now or heretofore employed by the British, French, Russian, or Italian Government in munitions factories of this country, including subjects of countries allied with the United States in war. In each case in which the War Department requests authority under this order it shall furnish to the Commission a list giving the name, designation, rate of pay, and nationality of each person proposed for employment.
