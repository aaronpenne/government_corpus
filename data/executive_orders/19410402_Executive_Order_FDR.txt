AMENDMENT OF SUBDIVISION IX, SCHEDULE B, CIVIL SERVICE RULES
April 2, 1941
By virtue of the authority vested in me by paragraph Eighth of subdivision SECOND of section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403, 404), it is ordered that Subdivision IX of Schedule B of the Civil Service Rules be, and it is hereby, amended by adding thereto the following paragraph:
'2. Classified positions in the Custodial Service, and in the Division of Equipment and Supplies under the Fourth Assistant Postmaster General, when filled by the promotion of unclassified laborers, subject to the approval of the Civil Service Commission.'
This order, which is recommended by the Civil Service Commission in view of the agreement by the Fourth Assistant Postmaster General that hereafter unclassified positions will be filled through appointment from appropriate classified registers as provided in section 3 of Civil Service Rule II, will permit unskilled personnel appointed from the unclassified laborer register to advance upon non-competitive examination to classified positions, but will not accord to such employees a classified status or render them eligible to transfer to classified positions in other branches of the Federal service.
