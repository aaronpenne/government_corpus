It is deemed desirable that the regulations governing appointments and employments of mere laborers and workmen in the Departments at Washington shall be extended, as rapidly as may be found practicable, to offices in the executive civil service outside of Washington.
The United States Civil Service Commission is therefore directed to render such assistance as may be practicable to the heads of the Executive Departments for the establishment and maintenance of a system of registration to test the relative fitness of applicants for appointment or employment as mere laborers and workmen, to precede such appointments or employments, which test shall be competitive and open to all citizens of the United States qualified in respect to age, physical ability, character, and experience as workmen, and for that purpose to conduct inquiries upon the request of the respective heads of Departments, under such regulations as may be agreed upon by them and the Commission. These regulations shall be forthwith prepared and applied in such large cities as may be agreed upon.
