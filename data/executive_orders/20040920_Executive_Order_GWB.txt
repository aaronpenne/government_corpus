By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act, as amended (22

I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, find that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 12543 of January 7, 1986, with respect to the policies and actions of the Government of Libya, and that led to the steps taken in that order and in Executive Order 12544 of January 8, 1986, and Executive Order 12801 of April 15, 1992, has been significantly altered by Libya's commitments and actions to eliminate its weapons of mass destruction programs and its Missile Technology Control Regime (MTCR) -class missiles, and by other developments. Accordingly, I hereby terminate the national emergency declared in Executive Order 12543, and revoke that Executive Order, Executive Order 12544, and Executive Order 12801. I also hereby revoke Executive Order 12538 of November 15, 1985, and further order:
