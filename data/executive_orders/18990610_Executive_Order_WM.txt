Consular court fees and fines imposed and collected by consular courts are hereby declared to be official. They are to be used to defer the expenses of consular courts, and detailed accounts of receipts and expenditures are to be rendered to the Secretary of State on the 30th of June of each year. Any surplus remaining at the end of the year after the expenses of the courts have been paid is to be turned into the Treasury.
The portions of the Executive Order of July 29, 1897, and the consular regulations in conflict with this order are hereby amended.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY
