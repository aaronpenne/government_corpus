WHEREAS, a dispute exists between The Denver & Rio Grande Western Railroad Company, including the Denver & Salt Lake Railroad Company, a carrier under Federal management, and certain workers represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, a labor organization; and 
WHEREAS by Executive Order No. 10155 of August 25, 1950, possession, control, and operation of the transportation system owned or operated by the said carrier, together with the transportation systems owned or operated by certain other carriers, were assumed by the President, through the Secretary of the Army; and 
WHEREAS the said dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and 
WHEREAS this dispute threatens, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service, and also threatens to interfere with the operation by the Secretary of the Army of transportation systems taken pursuant to the said Executive Order No. 10155:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), and subject to the provisions of that section, I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate the said dispute. Nothing in this order shall be construed to derogate from the authority of the Secretary of the Army under the said Executive Order No. 10155. 
The Board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the said dispute within thirty days from the date of this order. 
In performing its functions under this order the Board shall comply with the requirements of section 502 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended.
