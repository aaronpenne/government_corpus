By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 5785 (a) of title 10 of the United States Code, and finding that the needs of the Marine Corps so require, it is ordered as follows:
1. The operation of the provision of section 5751 (b) of title 10 of the United States Code which relates to the service-in-grade requirement for officers of the Marine Corps of the grade of captain for eligibility for consideration by a selection board for promotion to the next higher grade is hereby suspended until June 30, 1958.
2. This order supersedes Executive Order No. 10546 of July 16, 1954, entitled "Suspension of Certain Provisions of the Officer Personnel Act of 1947, as amended, Which Relate to Officers of the Marine Corps of the Grades of First Lieutenant and Captain."
