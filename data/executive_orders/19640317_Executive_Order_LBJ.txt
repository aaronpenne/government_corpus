WHEREAS disputes between the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference, designated in List A attached hereto and made a part hereof, and certain of their employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Boilermaker's, Iron Ship Builders, Blacksmiths, Forgers and Helpers; Brotherhood of Railway Carmen of America; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers; International Association of Machinists; Sheet Metal Workers' International Association; International Brotherhood of Firemen, Oilers, Helpers, Round House and Railway Shop Laborers functioning through the Railway Employees' Department, AFL-CIO, labor organizations; and
WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive the country of essential transportation service:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier.
The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the disputes within thirty days from the date of this order.
As provided by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the carriers represented by the National Railway Labor Conference, or by their employees, in the conditions out of which the disputes arose.
