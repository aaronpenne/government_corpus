By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 205 of the Credit Control Act (12 U.S.C. 1904), and having determined that the regulation and control of credit is necessary and appropriate for the purpose of preventing and controlling inflation generated by the extension of credit in an excessive volume, it is hereby ordered as follows:

The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is authorized to exercise all the authority under the Credit Control Act to regulate and control credit extended by those financial intermediaries which are not subject, as of the date hereof, to either the amendments of law effected by Public Law 89-597, as amended, or Section 19 of the Federal Reserve Act, as amended (12 U.S.C. 461), and which are primarily engaged in the extension of short-term credit. 
1-103. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System is authorized to exercise all the authority under the Credit Control Act to regulate and control credit extended to commercial banks that are not members of the Federal Reserve System in the form of managed liabilities.
