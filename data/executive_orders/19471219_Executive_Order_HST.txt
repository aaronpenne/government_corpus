By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the International Cotton Advisory Committee under the authority of an act of Congress authorizing such participation ort making an appropriation for such participation, I hereby designate such organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said Act.
The designation of the above-named organization as a public international organization within the meaning of the said International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges and immunities which such organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
This order supplements Executive Orders No. 9698 of February 19, 1946, No. 9751 of July 11, 1946, No. 9823 of January 24, 1947, No. 9863 of May 31, 1947, and No. 9887 of August 22, 1947.
