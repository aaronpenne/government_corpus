WHEREAS the Assignment of Claims Act of 1940, 54 Stat. 1029, as amended by the act of May 15, 1951, 65 Stat. 41 (31 U.S.C. 203), contains the following provisions:
Any contract of the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, the Atomic Energy Commission, or any other department or agency of the United States designated by the President, except any such contract under which full payment has been made, may, in time of war or national emergency proclaimed by the President (including the national emergency proclaimed December 16, 1950) or by Act or joint resolution of the Congress and until such war or national emergency has been terminated in such manner, provide or be amended without consideration to provide that payments to be made to the assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract shall not be subject to reduction or set-off, and if such provision or one to the same general effect has been at any time heretofore or is hereafter included or inserted in any such contract, payments to be made thereafter to an assignee of any moneys due or to become due under such contract, whether during or after such war or emergency, shall not be subject to reduction or set-off for any liability of any nature of the assignor to the United States or any department or agency thereof which arises independently of such contract, or hereafter for any liability of the assignor on account of (1) renegotiation under any renegotiation statute or under any statutory renegotiation article in the contract, (2) fines, (3) penalties (which term does not include amounts which may be collected or withheld from the assignor in accordance with or for failure to comply with the terms of the contract), or (4) taxes, social security contributions, or the withholding or non-withholding of taxes or social security contributions, whether arising from or independently of such contract.
AND WHEREAS it appears that it would be in the public interest to make those provisions applicable to the National Aeronautics and Space Administration:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the above-quoted statutory provisions, I hereby designate the National Aeronautics and Space Administration as an agency of the United States to which such statutory provisions shall apply in the same manner and to the same extent that they apply to the Department of Defense, the General Services Administration, and the Atomic Energy Commission.
