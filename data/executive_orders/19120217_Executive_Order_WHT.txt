Under authority of the act of Congress of June 4, 1897 (30 Stat., 11 at 34 and 36), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is hereby ordered that on and after March 1, 1912, the boundaries of the Apache National Forest, Ariz., as proclaimed March 2, 1909, and modified by subsequent proclamation of September 26, 1910, be further modified by excluding therefrom all that part of the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation included in said Apache National Forest by said proclamation of March 2, 1909, and not transferred to the Crook National Forest, Ariz., by proclamation of September 26, 1910. 
The purpose of this exclusion is to restore the White Mountain Apache Indian Reservation in all respects to the status existing prior to the said proclamation of March 2, 1909, as though the inclusion of the lands within the Apache National Forest had not been ordered, and said Indian reservation is hereby fully re-created and restored to that status.
