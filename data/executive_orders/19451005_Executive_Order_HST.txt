WHEREAS disputes exist between the Railway Express Agency, Inc., the carrier, and certain of its employees represented by the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Chauffeurs, Warehousemen, and Helpers of America, a labor organization; and
WHEREAS, these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS, these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a large section of the country of essential transportation service:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate said disputes. No member of the said board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railway employees or any carrier.
The board shall report is findings to the President with respect to the said disputes within thirty days from the date of this order.
As provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the Railway Express Agency, Inc. or their employees in the conditions out of which the said disputes arose.
