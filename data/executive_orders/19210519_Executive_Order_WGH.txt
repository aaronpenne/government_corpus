The death of the Honorable Edward Douglas White, Chief Justice of the United States, occurred this morning. In his death, the United States has lost one of its most distinguished citizens and public servants, whose legal training and profound knowledge of the law made him eminently fitted for the highest judicial office of the country.
He had served well and faithfully as a Senator of the United States, as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, and as Chief Justice of the United States. His judicial opinions, based always on the principles of right and justice, and unbiased by personal influences and consideration, will hold high rank among the decisions of the country's Highest Court of Justice.
His private life was simple and unaffected and was characterized by virtues which might well serve as example for the people of America.
In testimony of the respect in which his memory is held by the Government and people of the United States, and in recognition of his eminent and varied services as a public servant, I do hereby direct that the National Flag be displayed at half staff upon all the public buildings of the United States; that The White House and the several Executive Departments and Independent Government Establishments in the City of Washington be closed on the day of his funeral; that the usual and apptopriate military and naval honors be rendered, and that on all the legations and consulates of the United States in foreign countries, the National Flag shall be displayed at half staff for thirty days from the receipt of this order.
WARREN G. HARDING
The White House, May 19, 1921.
