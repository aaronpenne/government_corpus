By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), and by the joint resolution of June 30, 1961, 75 Stat. 194, I hereby designate the Caribbean Organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said International Organizations Immunities Act. 
The designation of the above-named organization as a public international organization within the meaning of the said Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities to which such international organization may otherwise be or become entitled. 
This order revokes Executive Order No. 10025 of December 30, 1948, to the extent that such order relates to the Caribbean Commission.
