I, GEORGE BUSH, President of the United States of America, find that the February 25, 1990, democratic election in Nicaragua has ended the unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States previously posed by the policies and actions of the Sandinista government in that country, and the need to continue the national emergency declared in Executive Order No. 12513 of May 1, 1985, to deal with that threat. 
I hereby revoke Executive Order No. 12513 and terminate the national emergency declared in that order with respect to Nicaragua.
