In further respect to the memory of the Honorable Everett McKinley Dirksen, late Minority Leader of the Senate of the United States, I direct that on the day of his interment, September 11, 1969, the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff on all buildings, grounds and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions.
I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations.
