By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, the Secretary of Transportation is hereby designated and empowered, in consultation with the Secretaries of State and Defense, and the heads of other appropriate agencies, to conduct the full and complete investigation and study, concerning the possible expansion of war risk insurance, required by Section 3 of H.R. 8564 which I have today signed into law, and to prepare a report on the results of the investigation and study, together with any recommendations for legislation. Since Section 3 (c) of H.R. 8564 provides for the President to transmit the report to the Congress within 90 days of enactment of this legislation, the proposed report should be submitted to me, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, within 70 days.
