By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. There is approved for the Office of National Drug Control Policy in the Executive Office of the President an official seal described as follows:
On a blue disc the Arms of the United States proper above a curved gold scroll inscribed "OFFICE OF NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL POLICY" in blue letters, all within a white border edged in gold and inscribed "EXECUTIVE OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES" in blue letters.
This design is appropriate for the Office of National Drug Control Policy. The dark blue in this seal is suggested by the Seal of the President and denotes the direct organizational link of the Office of National Drug Control Policy with the Presidential office. The Arms of the United States refer to the entire Nation and represent the involvement in drug control policies that are necessary to assist the President in his role as Chief Executive of the United States.
Sec. 2. The seal shall be of the design that is attached hereto and made a part of this order.
William J. Clinton
The White House,
April 25, 1994.
