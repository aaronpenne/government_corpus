Schedule A, Section VI, of the civil-service rules is hereby amended by striking out, in the first line of paragraph 10, the words "at Indian schools" and inserting in their place the words "in the Indian service."
As amended, paragraph 10 will read:
"10. Physicians employed by contract in the Indian service and receiving not more than $720 per annum salary, may lawfully perform their official duties in connection with their private practice, each employment, however, to be subject to the approval of the Commission."
