By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (59 Stat. 669; 22 U.S.C. 288), and having found that the United States participates in the Customs Cooperation Council pursuant to the Convention Establishing a Customs Cooperation Council of December 15,1950, TIAS 7063, I hereby designate the Customs Cooperation Council as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.
The designation of the Customs Cooperation Council as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act shall not be deemed to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which the organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or Congressional action.
