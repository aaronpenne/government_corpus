Under the provisions of Section 14 of the Federal Advisory Committee Act (5 U.S.C. App. I), each advisory committee created by the President or any other officer of the Executive Branch and subject to the provisions of this Act-in existence on the effective date of the Act, January 5, 1973-will terminate on January 5, 1975, unless renewed by the President or other appropriate officer. 
During the period elapsed since the Federal Advisory Committee Act was enacted, all Federal advisory committees subject to that Act have been thoroughly examined and reexamined to determine whether they should be continued, modified, abolished, or allowed to terminate. In that period, more than 300 Federal advisory committees have been abolished or allowed to terminate. 
All advisory committees created by the President before the effective date of the Act and subject to the provisions of the Act have been carefully examined. I have determined that those listed in Section 1 of this Order should be continued until January 5, 1977, unless terminated sooner. I have also determined that the advisory committees listed in Section 2 of this Order, created after the effective date of the Federal Advisory Committee Act-expiring under the terms of that Act before January 5, 1977-should be continued until that date, unless terminated sooner. 
Now, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FORD, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America, particularly by the Federal Advisory Committee Act, do hereby order as follows: 
SECTION 1. The following listed advisory committees are hereby continued until January 5, 1977, unless otherwise sooner terminated-
