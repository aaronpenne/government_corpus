EXECUTIVE ORDER 9523
AUTHORIZING THE SECRETARY OF WAR TO TAKE POSSESSION OF AND OPERATE THE PLANTS AND FACILITIES OF THE AMERICAN ENKA CORPORATION LOCATED AT OR NEAR ENKA, NORTH CAROLINA
February 18, 1945
WHEREAS after investigation I find and proclaim that the plants and facilities of the American Enka Corporation located at or near Enka, North Carolina, are plants and facilities that are equipped for the manufacture and production of articles or materials which may be required for the war effort or which may be useful in connection therewith; that as a result of labor disturbances there is a threatened interruption of the operations of the said plants and facilities of the American Enka Corporation; that the war effort will be unduly impeded or delayed by these interruptions and that the exercise as hereinafter specified of the powers and authority vested in me is necessary to insure in the interest of the war effort the operation of these plants and facilities:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including the War Labor Disputes Act and the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 as amended, as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, I hereby authorize the Secretary of War to take possession of the plants and facilities of the American Enka Corporation located at or near Enka, North Carolina, together with any real or personal property, wherever situated, used in connection therewith, and to operate such plants and facilities in accordance with the provisions of all applicable laws and in such manner as he may deem necessary for the effective prosecution of the war. Possession of any plants or facilities so taken shall be terminated by the Secretary of War within sixty days after he determines that such possession is no longer necessary for the effective prosecution of the war.
