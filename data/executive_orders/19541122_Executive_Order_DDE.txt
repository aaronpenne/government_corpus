By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution, by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes (5 U.S.C. 631), by the Civil Service Act of January 16, 1883 (22 Stat. 403), by section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
PART I-CIVIL SERVICE RULES SECTION 101.
The Civil Service Rules are hereby amended to read as follows:
RULE I-COVERAGE AND DEFINITIONS
SEC. 1.1 Positions and employees affected by these Rules. These Rules shall apply to all positions in the competitive service and to all incumbents of such positions. Except as expressly provided in the Rule concerned, these Rules shall not apply to positions and employees in the excepted service.
SEC. 1.2 Extent of the competitive service. The competitive service shall include: (a) All civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government unless specifically excepted therefrom by or pursuant to statute or by the Civil Service Commission (hereafter referred to in these Rules as the Commission) under section 6.1 of Rule VI; and (b) all positions in the legislative and judicial branches of the Federal Government and in the Government of the District of Columbia which are specifically made subject to the civil-service laws by statute. The Commission is authorized and directed to determine finally whether a position is in the competitive service.
SEC. 1.3 Definitions. As used in these Rules:
(a) "Competitive service" shall have the same meaning as the words "classified service", or "classified (competitive) service", or "classified civil service" as defined in existing statutes and executive orders.
(b) "Competitive position" shall mean a position in the competitive service.
(c) "Competitive status" shall mean basic eligibility to be noncompetitively selected to fill a vacancy in a competitive position. A competitive status shall be acquired by career-conditional or career appointment through open competitive examination upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, or may be granted by statute, executive order, or the Civil Service Rules without competitive examination. A person with competitive status may be promoted, transferred, reassigned, reinstated, or demoted without taking an open competitive examination, subject to the conditions prescribed by the Civil Service Rules and Regulations.
(d) An employee shall be considered as being in the competitive service when he has a competitive status and occupies a competitive position unless he is serving under a temporary appointment: Provided, That an employee who is in the competitive service at the time his position is first listed under Schedule A, B, or C shall be considered as continuing in the competitive service as long as he continues to occupy such position.
(e) "Tenure" shall mean the period of time an employee may reasonably expect to serve under his current appointment. Tenure shall be granted and governed by the type of appointment under which an employee is currently serving without regard to whether he has a competitive status or whether his appointment is to a competitive position or an excepted position.
SEC. 1A Extent of the excepted service. (a) The excepted service shall include all civilian positions in the executive branch of the Government which are specifically excepted from the requirements of the Civil Service Act or from the competitive service by or pursuant to statute or by the Commission under section 6.1 of Rule VI.

RULE IIâ€”APPOINTMENT THROUGH THE COMPETITIVE SYSTEM
SEC. 2.1 Competitive examinations and eligible registers. (a) The Commission shall be responsible for open competitive examinations for admission to the competitive service which will fairly test the relative capacity and fitness of the persons examined for the position to be filled. The Commission is authorized to establish standards with respect to citizenship, age, education, training and experience, suitability, and physical and mental fitness, and for residence or other requirements which applicants must meet to be admitted to or rated in examinations.
(b) In addition to the names of persons who qualify in competitive examinations, the names of persons who have lost eligibility on a career or career-conditional register because of service in the armed forces, and the names of persons who lost opportunity for certification or who have served under career or career-conditional appointment when the Commission determines that they should be given certification, may also be entered at such places on appropriate registers and under such conditions as the Commission may prescribe.
SEC. 2.2 Appointments. (a) The Commission shall establish and administer a career-conditional appointment system for positions subject to competitive examination which will permit adjustment of the career service to necessary fluctuations in Federal employment, and provide an equitable and orderly system for stabilizing the Federal work force. A competitive status shall be acquired by a career-conditional appointee upon satisfactory completion of a probationary period, but the appointee shall have career-conditional tenure for a period of service to be prescribed by regulation of the Commission. When an employee has completed the required period of service his appointment shall be converted to a career appointment without time limitation: Provided, That his career-conditional appointment shall not be converted to a career appointment if the limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service established under subsection (b) of this section would be exceeded thereby. Persons selected from competitive civil service registers for other than temporary appointment shall be given career-conditional appointments: Provided, That career appointments shall be given to the following classes of eligibles: (1) Persons whose appointments are required by statute to be made on a permanent basis; (2) employees serving under career appointments at the time of selection from such registers; (3) former employees who have eligibility for career appointments upon reinstatement; and (4) to the extent permitted by law, persons appointed to positions in the field service of the Post Office Department for which salary rates are fixed by the act of July 6, 1945, 59 Stat. 435, as heretofore or hereafter amended and supplemented.
(b) Under the career-conditional appointment system there shall be a limit on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service which shall be the ceiling established by section 1310 of the Supplemental Appropriation Act, 1952 (65 Stat. 757), as amended. In the event section 1310, supra, is repealed, the Commission is authorized to fix such limitation on the number of permanent employees in the Federal civil service as it finds necessary to meet the needs of the service.
(e) The Commission may determine the types, duration, and conditions of indefinite and temporary appointments, and may prescribe the method for replacing persons holding such appointments.
SEC. 2.3 Apportionment. Subject to such modifications as the Commission finds to be necessary in the interest of good administration, appointments to positions in agencies' headquarters offices which are located within the metropolitan area of Washington, D. C., shall be made so as to maintain the apportionment of appointments among the several States, Territories, and the District of Columbia upon the basis of population.
SEC. 2.4 Probationary period. Persons selected from registers of eligibles for career or career-conditional appointment shall be required to serve a probationary period under such terms and conditions as the Commission may prescribe.
RULE III-NONCOMPETITIVE ACQUISITION OF STATUS

(1) A person holding a permanent position when it is placed in the competitive service by statute or executive order or is otherwise made subject to competitive examination.
(2) A disabled veteran who, in a manner satisfactory to the Commission, has completed a course of training in the executive branch of the Government prescribed by the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs in accordance with the act of March 24, 1943, 57 Stat. 43.
(3) An employee who has served at least two years in the immediate office of the President or on the White House Staff and who is transferred to a competitive position at the request of an agency.
(4) An employee who was serving when his name was reached for certification on a civil-service register appropriate for the position in which he was serving: Provided, That the recommendation for competitive status is made prior to expiration of the register on which his name appears or is made during a period of continuous service since his name was reached: Provided further, That the register was being used for appointments conferring competitive status at the time his name was reached.
SEC. 3.2 Appointments without competitive examination in rare cases. Subject to receipt of satisfactory evidence of the qualifications of the person to be appointed, the Commission may authorize an appointment in the competitive service without competitive examination whenever it finds that the duties or compensation of the position are such, or that qualified persons are so rare, that, in the interest of good civil-service administration, the position cannot be filled through open competitive examination. Any person heretofore or hereafter appointed under this section shall acquire a competitive status upon completion of at least one year of satisfactory service and compliance with such requirements as the Commission may prescribe. Detailed statements of the reasons for the noncompetitive appointments made under this section shall be published in the Commission's annual reports.
SEC. 3.3 Conversion of appointments. Any person who acquires a competitive status under this Rule shall have his appointment converted to career-conditional appointment unless he meets the service requirement for career appointment prescribed under section 2.2 (a) of Rule II

All such persons shall retain the right to vote as they may choose and to express their opinions on all political subjects and candidates.
SEC. 4.2 Prohibition against racial, political or religious discrimination.

All disclosures concerning such matters shall be ignored, except as to such membership in political parties or organizations as constitutes by law a disqualification for Government employment. No discrimination shall be exercised, threatened, or promised by any person in the executive branch of the Federal Government against or in favor of any employee in the competitive service, or any eligible or applicant for a position in the competitive service because of his race, political affiliation or religious beliefs, except as may be authorized or required by law.
SEC. 4.3 Prohibition against securing withdrawal from competition. No person shall influence another person to withdraw from competition for any position in the competitive service for the purpose of either improving or injuring the prospects of any applicant for appointment. The Commission is authorized to take such disciplinary action as it deems appropriate whenever it finds that any person has violated this section.

SEC. 5.2 Authority of the Commission to make investigations. The Commission may make appropriate investigations to secure enforcement of the Civil Service Act, Rules, and Regulations, including investigation of the qualifications and suitability of applicants for positions in the competitive service. It may require appointments to be made subject to investigation to enable the Commission to determine, after appointment, that the requirements of law or the Civil Service Rules and Regulations have been met. Whenever the Commission finds that an employee serving under such an appointment is disqualified for Federal employment, it may instruct the agency to remove him, or to suspend him pending an appeal from the Commission's finding: Provided, That when an agency removes or suspends an employee pursuant to the Commission's instructions, and the Commission, on the basis of new evidence or on appeal, subsequently reverses the initial decision as to the employee's qualifications and suitability, the agency shall, upon request of the Commission, restore the employee to duty.
SEC. 5.3 Officers and employees to furnish testimony. All officers and employees in the executive branch, and applicants or eligibles for positions therein. shall give to the Commission or its authorized representatives all information and testimony in regard to matters inquired of arising under the laws, rules, and regulations administered by. the Commission. Whenever required by the Commission, such persons shall subscribe such testimony and make oath or affirmation thereto before an officer authorized by law to administer oaths.

(b) Whenever the Commission finds that any officer or employee in the executive branch has failed to adhere to established policies, regulations, and standards relating to personnel management subject to the jurisdiction of the Commission, it shall instruct the agency head to take corrective action.
(c) Whenever, on the basis of an appeal by an employee, the Commission finds that its regulations prescribing procedures to be followed by agencies in connection with adverse actions for disciplinary reasons have not been followed, or that adverse action has been taken for political reasons except as may be required by law, or resulted from discrimination because of marital status, it shall instruct the agency to restore the employee to duty.
(d) Whenever the Commission issues specific instructions as to discipline or dismissal of an officer or employee, or to restore an officer or employee to duty, the appointing officer concerned shall comply with the Commission's instructions.
(e) If the appointing officer fails to carry out the instructions of the Commission issued under section 4 (a) of this Rule, the Commission shall certify the facts to the head of the agency concerned.
