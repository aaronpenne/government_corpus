The death of George Bancroft, which occurred in the city of Washington on Saturday, January 17, at 3:40 o'clock p.m., removes from among the living one of the most distinguished Americans. As an expression of the public loss and sorrow the flags of all the Executive Departments at Washington and the public buildings in the cities through which the funeral party is to pass will be placed at half-mast on to-morrow and until the body of this eminent statesman, scholar, and historian shall rest in the State that gave him to his country and to the world.
By direction of the President:
ELIJAH W. HALFORD,
Private Secretary
