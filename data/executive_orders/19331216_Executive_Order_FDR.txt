BY virtue of the authority vested in me under Tide I of the National Industrial Recovery Act approved June 16, 1933 (Public No. 67, 73d Congress), and in order to effectuate the purposes of said Act, it is hereby ordered as follows:
(1) The National Labor Board, created on August 5, 1933, to "pass promptly on any case of hardship or dispute that may arise from interpretation or application of the President's Reemployment Agreement," shall continue to adjust all industrial disputes, whether arising out of the interpretation and operation of the President's Reemployment Agreement or any duly approved industrial code of fair competition, and to compose all conflicts threatening the industrial peace of the country. All action heretofore taken by this Board in the discharge of its function is hereby approved and ratified.
 (2) The powers and functions of said Board shall be as follows:
(a) To settle by mediation, conciliation, or arbitration all controversies between employers and employees which tend to impede the purposes of the National Industrial Recovery Act, provided, however, the Board may decline to take cognizance of controversies between employers and employees in any field of trade or industry where a means of settlement, provided for by agreement, industrial code, or Federal law, has not been invoked.
(b) To establish local or regional boards upon which employers and employees shall be equally represented, and to delegate thereto such powers and territorial jurisdiction as the National Labor Board may determine.
(c) To review the determinations of the local or regional boards where the public interest so requires.
(d) To make rules and regulations governing its procedure and the discharge of its functions.
