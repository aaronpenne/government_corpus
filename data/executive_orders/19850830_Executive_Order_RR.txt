A dispute exists between the United Transportation Union and certain railroads represented by the National Carriers' Conference Committee of the National Railway Labor Conference designated on the list attached hereto and made a part hereof. 
The dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended ("the Act"). 
This dispute, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service. 
Now, Therefore, by the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. § 160), it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. Establishment of Board. There is hereby established, effective August 30, 1985, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds. 
Sec. 2. Report. The board shall report its finding to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days from the date of its creation. 
Sec. 3. Maintaining Conditions. As provided by Section 10 of the Act, as amended, from the date of the creation of the board and for 30 days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement of the parties, shall be made by the carriers or the employees in the conditions out of which the dispute arose. 
Sec. 4. Expiration. The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in Section 2 of this Order.
