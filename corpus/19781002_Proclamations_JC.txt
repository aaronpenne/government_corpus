By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. By Proclamation No. 4125 of April 22, 1972, the President proclaimed increased duties on certain types of ceramic tableware that are defined in items 923.01 through 923.15 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS). These increased duties were to be effective from May 1, 1972, through April 30, 1976, unless modified or terminated earlier. This action was taken under the following legal provisions: section 350(a) (1) (B) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1351(a)(1)(B)); and sections 201(a) (2), 302(a) (2) and (3), and 351(a) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1821(a) (2), 19 U.S.C. 1902(a) (2) and (3), and 19 U.S.C. 1981 (a)). 
2. By Proclamation No. 4436 of April 30, 1976, the President proclaimed the extension and modification of the increased rates of duty then in effect on imports of some of the articles of ceramic tableware provided for in items 923.01, 923.07, 923.13, and 923.15 of the TSUS. This was done under section 203(h) (3) of the Trade Act of 1974 ( 19 U.S.C. 2253 (h) (3)). 
3. I have determined, pursuant to section 203(h) (4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (4)) and section 351(c) (1)(A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1981 (c) (1) (A)), after taking into account the advice of the U.S. International Trade Commission and after seeking the advice of the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor as required by those sections, that it is in the national interest to terminate the increased rates of duty currently in effect on imports of the articles of ceramic tableware now provided for in items 923.01, 923.07, 923.13 and 923.15 of the TSUS. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 203(h) (4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2253(h) (4)) and section 351(c)(1)(A) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1981(c) (1) (A)), and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), do proclaim that- 
(1) The modifications of tariff concessions on ceramic tableware provided for in items 533.28, 533.38, 533.73, and 533.75 in Part I of Schedule XX to the GATT made by Proclamations Nos. 4125 and 4436 are terminated; 
(2) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified by deleting items 923.01,923.07, 923.13, and 923.15, including the superior headings thereto; 
(3) The modifications of Part I of Schedule XX to the GATT and of the Appendix to the TSUS made by paragraphs (1) and (2) hereof shall be effective as to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption on or after the date of publication of this Proclamation in the FEDERAL REGISTER. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
