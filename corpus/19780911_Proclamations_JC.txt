A Proclamation
 
Among the great days of national remembrance, none is more deeply moving to Americans than Veterans Day. On this occasion, our nation traditionally joins together to salute those valiant individuals who have served in the Armed Forces. 
This is a very special day. It symbolizes the debt of gratitude we owe our veterans. It reminds us that the freedom we enjoy has endured intact because millions of patriotic men and women answered their country's call to service and sacrifice. 
Our veterans have not sought glory for themselves, but peace and freedom for us all. They represent the spirit that has preserved us as a great nation. They deserve our recognition for all they have done. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, invite all Americans to observe Saturday, November 11, 1978, as Veterans Day and on this historic occasion, let us resolve anew to keep faith with those whose love of country has set them in an imperishable roll of honor. 
I urge all the families and friends of our sick and disabled veterans to visit them and extend to them a grateful nation's promise that they will not be forgotten. 
I call upon Federal, State, and local Government officials to mark Veterans Day by displaying the flag of the United States, and by encouraging and supporting public involvement in appropriate ceremonies throughout the country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
