A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 those foreign patriots who fought on American soil for the achievement of our liberty should live forever in our memories and be enshrined forever in our hearts; and
Whereas
, shortly after the adoption of the Declaration of Independence by the Founding Fathers, valiant Count Casimir Pulaski of Poland journeyed to our shores and volunteered for service in the American Revolutionary Army; and
Whereas
 this intrepid soldier, who achieved the rank of Brigadier General and Chief of Cavalry, made the supreme sacrifice in the cause of freedom on October 11, 1779, dying as a result of wounds received two days earlier at Savannah, Georgia; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that in recognition of his inspiring deeds we should pay public tribute to Casimir Pulaski on the one hundred and seventieth anniversary of his death:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe Tuesday, October 11, 1949, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day as a mark of respect to the memory of General Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
