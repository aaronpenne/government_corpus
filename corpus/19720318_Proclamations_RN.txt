By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
For much of our history, Americans have confronted nature as a hostile force to be reckoned with and overcome. The wild creatures of forest and plains, mountains and swamp, were seen as threats to human life' and progress on the edge of the wilderness. They were beaten back or disposed of accordingly.
More recently, Americans have come to see wild animals as coinhabitants of a small planet, fellow creatures who have a rightful place in a healthy natural environment. Ecologist, philosopher, and outdoorsman alike have come to know the truth of Thoreau's words, "In Wildness is the preservation of the World." Men and animals can and must share the earth. The various forms of wildlife which give life and variety and beauty to the environment can and must be recognized, appreciated, and protected.
But the hour is late, and the time to act is now. Already some species of wildlife have been extinguished forever, and many others have been sharply reduced in numbers. Economically, we can now afford to take humane action to reverse this tragic trend. Morally and esthetically, we cannot afford to do otherwise.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 19, 1972, as National Wildlife Week.
I call upon all our citizens to join during that week in support of the many organizations dedicated to preserving a suitable environment for the greatest possible number of wildlife species. In particular, I urge broad public support for, and prompt congressional action on, my recent proposals for better protection of endangered species.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
