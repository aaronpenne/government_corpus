A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the experience of an increasing number of employers has proved that physically handicapped workers, when placed in jobs suited to their abilities, can make a substantial contribution to the economic well-being of our country; and
Whereas
 the present need for maximum production requires the utilization of all our human resources; and
Whereas
 physically handicapped men and women should have an equal opportunity with others to earn a livelihood; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), has designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week and has requested the President to issue a suitable proclamation each year, with a view to enlisting national interest in the employment of these men and women;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 1, 1950, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and with the corresponding Governors' committees in the several States and Territories, in carrying out the purposes of the joint resolution of Congress. I also request the Governors of States, the mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as employers and leaders of labor, agricultural, veterans', women's, civic, and religious organizations and all other interested groups representative of our national life, to observe the week by endeavoring to enlist the widest possible public interest in additional employment opportunities for the physically handicapped.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
