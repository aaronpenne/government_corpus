A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the year 1959 marks the twentieth anniversary of little league baseball; and
Whereas
 little league baseball has contributed much to a wider interest in the game and encouraged our young people to direct their energies in healthful, competitive team sports; and
Whereas
 participation in this sport by boys—and by their adult leaders—has helped to develop a feeling of fair play, community spirit and respect for the discipline of rules and decisions; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Concurrent Resolution 17, agreed to June 1, 1959, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the week beginning the second Monday in June of each year as National Little League Baseball Week, in recognition of the national and community benefits resulting from little league activities:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning the second Monday in June of 1959, and the week beginning the second Monday in June of each succeeding year, as National Little League Baseball Week.
And I invite the people of the United States to observe such week each year in schools, parks, athletic fields, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies and activities designed to further the objectives of our national youth fitness program.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
