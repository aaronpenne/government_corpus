By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Recent shifts in our culture and society have created new patterns of life for many American mothers and families. 
Some of these changes have been desirable, and some not so desirable. But all have put new burdens on the women who must adapt to the shifts--the mothers of America. 
By and large they have met the challenge of change with grace, intelligence, and dignity. 
Mother's Day should no longer be merely a day on which we reaffirm our love for our mothers. It should also be an occasion for admiration of the way American mothers have maintained those family bonds that protect us from the uncertainties of a changing society and give meaning and direction to our lives. 
And it should be an occasion for those of us in public life to reflect on what government can do to help the mothers of America keep our families strong. 
In recognition of the contributions of all mothers to their families and to the Nation, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), designated the second Sunday in May each year as Mother's Day and requested the President to call for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 8, 1977, be observed as Mother's Day. I call upon government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 21st day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
