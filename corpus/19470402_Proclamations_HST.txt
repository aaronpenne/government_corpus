A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 more fatal accidents occur in agriculture than in any other occupation; and
Whereas
 the increasing complexity of modern farm operations creates additional accident hazards; and 
Whereas
 caution and intelligent effort on the part of every farm family in the land will lessen the suffering and economic loss caused by accidents, and the coordinated observance by all our people of a week dedicated to farm safety will effect an immense saving to our country:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week commencing July 20, 1947 as National Farm Safety Week, as a spearhead to a year-round farm safety program, and I request all persons and organizations concerned with agriculture and farm life to cooperate in the observance of this fourth annual National Farm Safety Week. I also urge farm people everywhere to set aside a specific time during National Farm Safety Week for family discussions of methods for the prevention of accidents, in order that these producers of the Nation's food may live and work with greater safety.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 2nd day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
