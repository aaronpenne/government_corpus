A Proclamation
 
Whereas a joint resolution of the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States was duly approved on the 13th day of March last, which resolution is as follows:
 Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America in Congress assembled
 , That it be, and is hereby, recommended by the Senate and House of Representatives to the people of the several States that they assemble in their several counties or towns on the approaching centennial anniversary of our national independence, and that they cause to have delivered on such day an historical sketch of said county or town from its formation, and that a copy of said sketch may be filed, in print or manuscript, in the clerk's office of said county, and an additional copy, in print or manuscript, be filed in the office of the Librarian of Congress, to the intent that a complete record may thus be obtained of the progress of our institutions during the first centennial of their existence.
And whereas it is deemed proper that such recommendation be brought to the notice and knowledge of the people of the United States:
Now, therefore, I, Ulysses S. Grant, President of the United States, do hereby declare and make known the same, in the hope that the object of such resolution may meet the approval of the people of the United States and that proper steps may be taken to carry the same into effect.
Given under my hand, at the city of Washington, the 25th day of May, A. D. 1876, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundredth.
U.S. GRANT.
