A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the bounty of our forest and timber lands provides our people with a source of strength and pride; and
Whereas
 as a major renewable resource, supported by the science of modern forestry, wood offers the availability and abundance to satisfy the Nation's ever growing needs for many products—lumber, paper, building materials, chemicals, furniture, and cloth—all dedicated to improving the lives of our people; and
Whereas
 the Congress, in order to reemphasize the importance of our forest resources, has by a joint resolution approved September 13, 1960, designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 16, 1960, as National Forest Products Week, with activities and ceremonies designed to focus attention on the importance of our forests and forest products to the Nation's economy and welfare.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington, this fifteenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
