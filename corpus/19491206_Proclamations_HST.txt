A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 under the Charter of the United Nations member governments have pledged themselves to promote universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion; and
Whereas
 on December 10, 1948, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a common standard of achievement for all peoples and all nations; and
Whereas
 the Declaration enumerates civil, political, economic, social, and cultural rights and calls upon every individual and every organ of society to "strive by teaching and education to promote respect for these rights and freedoms and by progressive measures, national and international, to secure their universal and effective recognition and observance"; and
Whereas
 the attainment of basic rights for men and women everywhere is essential to the peace we are seeking:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate December 10, 1949, and December 10 of each succeeding year as United Nations Human Rights Day; and I invite the people of the United Stets to observe such day in appropriate manner.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this sixth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
