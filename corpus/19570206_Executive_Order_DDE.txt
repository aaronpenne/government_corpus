By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 1745 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, as amended, (22 U.S.C. 1201), it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Officers of the Foreign Service of the United States shall charge and collect for official services performed abroad fees as prescribed in the following schedule, designated as the Tariff of Fees, Foreign Service of the United States of America.
SEC. 2. No fees other than those prescribed in the foregoing Tariff of Fees, or fees prescribed by or pursuant to an act of Congress, shall be charged or collected by officers of the Foreign Service for official services performed abroad.
SEC. 3. All fees shall be collected in the coin of the United States or at its representative value in exchange.
SEC. 4. All fees shall be paid in advance: Provided, That in case the service is performed elsewhere than at a Foreign Service office, or in case the amount to be charged cannot be determined until the service is performed, the amount of the fee shall be carefully estimated, and the estimated amount of the fee shall be deposited with the officer before the service is performed, subject to refundment of any sum in excess of the amount chargeable under the foregoing Tariff of Fees.
SEC. 5. Notwithstanding section 1 of this order, no fees prescribed in the foregoing Tariff of Fees shall be charged or collected by consular officers for official services to American vessels and seamen. The term "American vessels" as used herein shall not include undocumented American vessels; and the fees prescribed in the said Tariff of Fees shall be charged and collected for official services performed for such undocumented vessels.
SEC. 6. In addition to the fees prescribed in the said Tariff of Fees, transportation and other incidental costs actually and necessarily incurred by officers of the Foreign Service performing services elsewhere than at a Foreign Service office, shall be collected from the persons requesting the performance of such services. Such collections shall not be considered as part of the official fees but shall be recorded as deposit funds and accounted for as such, with full identifying data on vouchers and records, including the number, date, and nature of the service in connection with which the expenses are incurred, and the names of the interested parties.
