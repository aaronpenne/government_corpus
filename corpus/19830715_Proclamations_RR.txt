By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Between 1945 and 1963 the United States conducted some 235 atmospheric nuclear weapons tests in the Pacific and the American Southwest. At least 220,000 American service men and women witnessed and participated in these tests, or served in forces occupying Hiroshima and Nagasaki immediately following World War II. It is only fitting that their dedication to duty be afforded proper recognition and brought to the attention of the American people. 
Many of these American service men and women witnessed the awesome potential of nuclear weapons. In honoring these veterans, let us rededicate ourselves once more to our national goal of a world at peace in which nuclear war is unthinkable. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 68, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating July 16, 1983, as "National Atomic Veterans' Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, July 16, 1983, as National Atomic Veterans' Day, a day dedicated to those patriotic Americans who through their participation in these tests helped lead the United States to the forefront of technology in defense of our great Nation and the freedoms we as Americans hold so dear. I urge my fellow citizens to join with me in appreciation of their service to their country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 15th day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightythree, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
