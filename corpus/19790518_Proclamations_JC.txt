By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Museums are the custodians of a substantial part of humankind's heritage, whether produced by the skill of our ancestors or by our contemporaries. 
Museums are centers of research for scholars, of education, of enlightenment for younger generations, and a source of enjoyment and cultural enhancement for all. 
Museums enrich the quality of our communities and provide a sense of continuity and perspective which can enhance, in a unique way, the cultural opportunities which are provided by schools, colleges, universities, libraries and other institutions of learning. 
In recognition of the contribution made by the museums of our Nation to the preservation of the heritage of the United States and to the furtherance and understanding of the peoples of the United States the 96th Congress, by House Joint Resolution 262, has designated May 18, 1979, as National Museum Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 18, 1979, as National Museum Day, and call upon the people of the United States, State and local government agencies, and interested organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 18th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
