A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the armed forces of the United States serve this Nation with unselfish devotion not only in time of war, but also in time of peace; and
Whereas
 our fighting forces, welded into a unified team that symbolizes our strength as a united people, have been waging the battle of freedom in Korea and are guarding the vital interests of peace in other lands across the sea; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we devote one day each year to paying special tribute to these defenders of our liberty:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 17, 1952, as Armed Forces Day; and I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force to arrange for the military observance of that day and to cooperate with civil authorities in suitable commemorative ceremonies.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to arrange for celebrations designed to honor the members of the armed forces on the designated day; and I request all of our citizens to display the flag of the United States on that day as a token of our gratitude to the men and women of the military services.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
