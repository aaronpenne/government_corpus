 the one hundred eighty-second anniversary of the death of Casimir Pulaski during the American. Revolution brings to mind the heroic contribution of that great Polish patriot to the cause of our freedom and independence; and

I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and the noble cause for which he gave his life. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
