By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the act of February 8, 1887 (ch. 119, 24 Stat. 388, 389), and by the act of June 21, 1906 (ch. 3504, 34 Stat. 325, 326), it is ordered that the period of trust applying to any Indian allotted lands of the Otoe Reservation, Oklahoma, or of any other Indian reservation in the State of Oklahoma not specifically named herein, upon which the period of trust expires during the calendar year 1935, be, and it is hereby, extended for a period of ten years from the date on which any such trust would otherwise expire. 
This order is not intended to apply to cases in which Congress has specifically reserved to itself authority to extend the period of trust on tribal or individual Indian lands.
