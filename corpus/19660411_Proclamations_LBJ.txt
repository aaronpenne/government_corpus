A Proclamation
One hundred ninety-one years ago, the frontiersman Daniel Boone opened the American West for an expanding nation. In the year 1775 he cut the 200 mile Wilderness Road through the Cumberland Gap to the Kentucky River. There he established the settlement of Boonesborough, one of the first great outposts on America's march toward the Pacific Coast. 
Daniel Boone is a renowned early American pioneer whose name is particularly associated with the State of Kentucky and with the Cumberland Gap. Most of the wilderness, as he knew it, has long since vanished from the face of America. Yet, farsighted conservationists of past generations and today have preserved much of the forests and valleys in which he spent his life. 
Among the 186 million acres of natural forest and grasslands, none is more beautiful nor more strongly associated with the spirit and the symbol of Daniel Boone than the Cumberland National Forest in the State of Kentucky. 
It is fitting and appropriate that being so associated with his spirit, it should also carry his name. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 24 of the Act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1103, as amended (16 U.S.C. 471), the Act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 34, 36 (16 U.S.C. 473), and by Section 11 of the Act of March 1, 1911, 36 Stat. 963 (16 U.S.C. 521), do hereby proclaim that the Cumberland National Forest in the State of Kentucky, as defined by Proclamation 2227 of February 23, 1937 (50 Stat. 1818), is hereby designated and hereafter shall be known as the Daniel Boone National Forest. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eleventh day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
