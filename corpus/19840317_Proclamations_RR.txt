By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
America's vast energy resources are among its greatest assets. Intelligent use of our existing energy supplies together with prudent conservation measures and development of alternative sources of supply will allow this country to maintain its position of world leadership and help ensure a higher standard of living and greater prosperity for all our people. 
The shift in Government policy away from artificial controls to an emphasis on free market forces has produced adequate supplies of energy at affordable prices. The impact of this policy shift was clearly demonstrated by deregulation of petroleum prices, which resulted in greater production of energy, more efficient use of energy, and lower energy costs for consumers. We anticipate a similar experience with the move toward a freer market in natural gas. 
Fundamental changes in the energy future of the United States and moves toward even greater energy security require that all grade levels of the American educational system prepare our youth for the new demands and challenges that lie ahead. In recognition of this fact and to bring together students, teachers, school officials, and community officials to focus on the need for a greater understanding of energy issues, Congress has, by Senate Joint Resolution 146, requested the President to proclaim March 23, 1984, as "National Energy Education Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 23, 1984, as National Energy Education Day. I call upon educational institutions, Federal agencies, and all Americans to participate in appropriate ceremonies and activities on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
