A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 in the year 1492 Christopher Columbus sailed westward across an uncharted sea and planted his banner on the shores of the New World; and
Whereas
 this intrepid explorer, whose voyage opened the way for the eventual establishment of our Nation and its free institutions, symbolizes the American heritage of discovery and daring achievement; and
Whereas
 the qualities of Columbus—his courage, his vision, and his loyalty to a great cause—are a constant inspiration to us as we seek to reach ever higher levels of accomplishment, both as individuals and as a Nation; and
Whereas
, in recognition of our indebtedness to Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 12, 1959, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in commemoration of the four hundred and sixty-seventh anniversary of the discovery of America.
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in honor of the memory of Christopher Columbus.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
