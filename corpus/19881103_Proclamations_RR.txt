By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
For a century now, the jukebox has been a fixture of popular culture in our land. In restaurants, diners, and clubs across our country, jukeboxes have long provided patrons with music for dining and dancing. The jukebox is to many a symbol of good, clean fun. It is also an inexpensive source of entertainment for young and old alike, and a treasury of memories for listeners of every generation. The centennial of the jukebox now gives all of us an excellent opportunity to celebrate its enduring place in American life. 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 446, has designated the week of October 30 through November 5, 1988, as "National Jukebox Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 30 through November 5, 1988, as National Jukebox Week. I call upon the American people to celebrate this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.
RONALD REAGAN
