A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved September 27, 1950 (Public Law 853, 81st Congress), the Congress has expressed its endorsement of the establishment of the Inter-American Cultural and Trade Center in Miami, Florida, as a permanent, nonprofit, self-sustaining enterprise for the development of improved relations and increased trade with the republics of Latin America; and

Whereas
 the joint resolution also recites that the State of Florida and the city of Miami will donate lands and money for the construction of this Center; and
Whereas
 the effective functioning of the Center will encourage the mutually beneficial exchange of goods and services between the nations of the Western Hemisphere, thereby fostering the solidarity of the American republics; and
Whereas
 the aforesaid joint resolution authorizes and requests the President, by proclamation or ion such other manner as he may deem proper, to grant recognition to the Inter-American Cultural and Trade Center in Miami:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, in consonance with the joint resolution, do hereby call upon officials and agencies of the Government to assist and cooperate with the Inter-American Cultural and Trade Center in Miami, Florida, and I invite the participation of all the nations of the Western Hemisphere therein.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
