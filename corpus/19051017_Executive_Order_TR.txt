When the President or head of an executive department is satisfied that an officer or employee in the classified service is inefficient or incapable, and that the public service will be materially improved by his removal, such removal will be made without hearing, but the cause of removal shall be stated in writing and filed. When misconduct is committed in the view and presence of the President or head of an executive department, removal may be made summarily and without notice.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
