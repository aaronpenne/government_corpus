A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 a state of war unhappily exists between Italy, on the one hand, and Greece, on the other hand;
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, in order to preserve the neutrality of the United States and of its citizens and of persons within its territory and jurisdiction, and to enforce its laws and treaties, and in order that all persons, being warned of the general tenor of the laws and treaties of the United States in this behalf, and of the law of nations, may thus be prevented from any violation of the same, do hereby declare and proclaim that all the provisions of my proclamation of September 5, 1939, proclaiming the neutrality of the United States in a war between Germany and France; Poland; and the United Kingdom, India, Australia and New Zealand apply equally in respect to Greece.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
