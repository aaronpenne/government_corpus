By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Columbus Day is a symbol of the debt our Nation owes to Italian-Americans. 
During the past four hundred years, millions of Italians have become Italian-Americans. Many of them arrived in this country without money or property or friends. They had only the hope of opportunity and the strength of their character. They took advantage of opportunities which America offered and the result has been an extraordinary contribution to every facet of American life. 
In recognition of the many contributions of Italian-Americans to our country, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 568, has requested the President to designate the week of October 12 through October 19, 1980, as Italian-American Heritage Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of October 12 through October 19, 1980, as Italian-American Heritage Week. I call upon the people of the United States, State and local agencies, and interested organizations to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies, activities, and programs. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
JIMMY CARTER
