A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Navajo National Monument, Arizona, created by proclamation dated March 20, 1909, after careful examination and survey of the prehistoric cliff dwelling pueblo ruins, has been found to reserve a much larger tract of land than is necessary for the protection of such of the ruins as should be reserved, and therefore the same should be reduced in area to conform to the requirements of the act authorizing the creation of National Monuments; 
Now, Therefore, I, William H. Taft,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by Section two of the act of Congress entitled, "an act for the Preservation of American Antiquities", approved June 8, 1906, do hereby set aside and reserve, subject to any valid existing rights, as the Navajo National Monument, within the Navajo Indian Reservation, two tracts of land containing one hundred and sixty acres each, and within which are situated prehistoric ruins known as "Betata Kin" and "Keet Seel," respectively, and one tract of land, containing forty acres, and within which is situated a prehistoric ruin known as "Inscription House". The approximate location of these tracts is shown upon the diagram which is hereto attached and made a part of this proclamation. 
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, excavate, injure or destroy any of the ruins or relics hereby declared to be a National Monument, or to locate or settle upon any of the lands reserved and made a part of this Monument by this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the city of Washington this 14th day of March, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twelve, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-sixth. 
WILLIAM HOWARD TAFT

HUNTINGTON WILSON
