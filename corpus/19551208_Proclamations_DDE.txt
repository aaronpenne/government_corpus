A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 10, 1955, marks the seventh anniversary of the proclaiming of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights by the General Assembly of the United Nations as a common standard of achievement for all nations and all peoples, and will be observed by the members of the United Nations as Human Rights Day; and
Whereas
 December 15, 1955, marks the one hundred and sixty-fourth anniversary of the adoption of our Bill of Rights as the first ten Amendments to the Constitution of the United States; and
Whereas
 the great fundamental of our national life is our common belief that every human being is divinely endowed with dignity and worth and with inalienable rights, and that to grow and flourish people must be free; and
Whereas
 one of the great purposes of our Government is to maintain freedom and justice among ourselves and to champion them for others so that we may work effectively for enduring peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 10, 1955, as United Nations Human Rights Day. I do call upon the people of the United States to celebrate this day by the study and reading of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaimed by the United Nations, and the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States, that we may strengthen our determination that every citizen of the United States shall have the opportunity to develop to his fullest capacity in accord with the faith which gave birth to this nation, and may realize more fully our obligation to labor earnestly, patiently, and prayerfully for peace, freedom, and justice throughout the world.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this Eighth day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
