A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American people, who detest war and reject it as an instrument of national policy, were nevertheless drawn into two world-wide conflicts within one generation, in the defense of freedom, and are even now engaged in an epic struggle against shameless aggression; and
Whereas
 the Armistice of November 11, 1918, which furled the flags of World War I, brought hope and promise to us and to all mankind that wars between nations were at an end; and
Whereas
 the Congress passed a concurrent resolution on June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 2982), calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies, and later provided in an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), that the eleventh of November should be a legal holiday and should be celebrated and known as Armistice Day; and
Whereas
 renewed acts of aggression have stressed the need for a spiritual rededication to the ideal of lasting peace, which seemed close to fulfillment on Armistice Day in 1918;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe Tuesday, November 11, 1952, by commemorating the heroic sacrifices made by our fellow countrymen across the seas, and I urge all our citizens to devote themselves anew on that day to the task of promoting a permanent peace among all the people of the earth. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Armistice Day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 24th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DAVID BRUCE,
