A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the broad and varied forests of our Nation constitute one of its most important resources--renewable, versatile, and available; and 
Whereas
 this forest resource, under both public and private ownership, provides basic raw materials for tremendous quantities of essential industrial and consumer products such as lumber, paper, building materials, chemicals, furniture and cloth; offers a productive outlet for a large segment of our Nation's labor force and industrial capability; and, with a broader application of scientific knowledge, affords an outstanding opportunity for the improvement of economic and social conditions in our forested rural areas; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, wishing to re-emphasize the importance and the possibilities of our forest heritage, has by joint resolution approved September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898, designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue an annual proclamation calling for the observance of that week:

In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
