In all applications by any invalid to obtain a pension in consequence of any disability incurred, no payment therefore shall commence until proof shall be filed in the Department and the decision of the Secretary had thereon; and no pension will be allowed to anyone while acting as an officer of the Army except in cases which have been heretofore adjudged.
Approved, 8th April, 1829.
