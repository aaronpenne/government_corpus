A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on June 14, 1777, the thirteen colonies assembled in the Continental Congress chose, as a symbol of unity in their struggle for independence, the flag of the United States consisting of thirteen stripes of red and white and a union of thirteen white stars in a blue field; and 
Whereas
 that new nation, of thirteen states, born from the wisdom and courage of our Founding Fathers and dedicated to freedom and equality for all, has grown to fifty states whose Stars and Stripes have come to symbolize throughout the world a haven for all races, creeds, and convictions; and 
Whereas
, engaged now in a protracted struggle to maintain the liberty of free men in a dangerous and uncertain world, we need to turn frequently for inspiration to the principles of freedom and justice for which our flag and Nation stand and to the self-sacrifice and vision which have preserved them; and 
Whereas
, in commemoration of the birthday of our flag, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Friday, June 14, 1963. 
I also call upon all fellow Americans to observe Flag Day by flying the Stars and Stripes at their homes or other suitable places and by pondering our duties and responsibilities as well as our rights and blessings as Americans, to the end that we may more fully achieve the ideals of justice and liberty for which our flag and our country stand. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
