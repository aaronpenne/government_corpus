A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 June 14, 1952, marks the 175th anniversary of the adoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress; and
Whereas
 people of many national origins and religious beliefs have found refuge from oppression and an opportunity for a better life under this beloved standard; and
Whereas
 this flag is not only a symbol of freedom cherished by all Americans, but also an emblem of hope to millions of people dominated by ruthless dictatorships or living under oppressive economic conditions; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), has designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day, in commemoration of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes on June 14, 1777, as our national flag:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag be displayed on all Government buildings on Saturday, June 14, 1952, and I call upon the people of the Nation to observe that day by suitable ceremonies, including the display of the flag at their homes and other appropriate places.
I also urge all our citizens to give special thought on Flag Day not only to their many rights and privileges but also to their duties and responsibilities under our national ensign, to the end that we may rededicate ourselves on that day to the principles of freedom and justice for which this Nation and its flag have always stood.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DAVID BRUCE,
Acting Secretary of State.
