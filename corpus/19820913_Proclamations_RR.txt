By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Our best research shows that both the supportive atmosphere parents create at home and the high expectations of motivated teachers will find positive expression in the academic achievements of students. 
Within our parent-teacher associations across the Nation, the combined concern of parents and teachers focuses on encouraging excellence in the education of our children. The National Parent Teacher Association, representing over twenty-nine thousand State and local units with more than six million active members, is a volunteer organization that has made substantial contributions to that goal. The ultimate beneficiary is the Nation itself, through enhanced student achievement and a citizenry better prepared for its future. 
In recognition of the important contributions made by the National P.T.A., the Congress by joint resolution (Public Law 97154) has requested the President to issue an appropriate proclamation recognizing October 1982 as "National P.T.A. Membership Month." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of October 1982 as "National P.T.A. Membership Month." I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States, and the American people to join me in recognizing and encouraging the efforts of the National P.T.A. on behalf of our children, and to observe such month with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 13th. day of Sept. in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
