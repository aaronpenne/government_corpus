WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between Lockheed Aircraft Corporation and certain of its employees represented by the International Association of Machinists; and 
WHEREAS, such dispute has resulted in a strike which, in my opinion, affects a substantial part of the ballistics missile, space vehicle and military aircraft industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, and transportation among the several States, and which strike will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety: 
NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155 (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of Professor Arthur M. Ross, Chairman, Honorable Frederick H. Bullen and the Honorable Paul D. Hanlon as members, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute. 
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of such Act on or before Monday, December 3, 1962. 
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such Act.
