By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On the morning of December 7, 1941, the Imperial Japanese Navy launched an unprovoked surprise attack on units of the Armed Forces of the United States stationed at Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. Over 2,400 United States citizens were killed and almost 1,200 were wounded in the attack. This battle marked our entry into World War II and galvanized the will of the American people to achieve ultimate victory. 
Today, Japan is firmly united with us as an ally in defense of the freedom we share. But the lesson of Pearl Harbor is as important today as it was over forty years ago. In an uncertain world, democracies should always seek peace but also be prepared to defeat aggression. Military strength can deter war and give diplomacy time to achieve its beneficial results. 
The people of the United States owe a tremendous debt of gratitude to all members of our Armed Forces who served at Pearl Harbor and in the many battles that followed in all other theaters of action of World War II. Their selfless dedication and sacrifice will never be forgotten. 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 392, has designated December 7, 1984, as "National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 7, 1984, as National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day and call upon the people of the United States to observe this solemn occasion with appropriate ceremonies and activities and to pledge eternal vigilance and strong resolve to defend this Nation and its allies from all future aggression. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this fourth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
