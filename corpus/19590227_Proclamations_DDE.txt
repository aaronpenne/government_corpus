By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as then amended (19 U.S.C. 1351), the President entered into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat. (pts. 5 and 6) A?, All and A2051) of the Governments of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Greece, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Italy, the Republic of Liberia, the Republic of Nicaragua, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, which trade agreement for accession consists of the Annecy Protocol of Terms of Accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 10, 1949, including the annexes thereto (64 Stat. (pt. 3) B139);
2. 
Whereas
, by Proclamation No. 2867 of December 22, 1949 (64 Stat. (pt. 2) A380), the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and the other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the designated trade agreement for accession on and after January 1, 1950;
3. 
Whereas
 that proclamation has been supplemented by subsequent proclamations including Proclamation No. 3040 of December 24, 1953 (68 Stat. (pt. 2) C26);
4. 
Whereas
 the seventh recital of Proclamation No. 3040 set forth that serious problems which had developed in the cattle and beef situation in the United States since the negotiation of the trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation rendered inappropriate the application to the products specified in items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of that trade agreement of rates of duty lower than the rates then applicable to such products;
5. 
Whereas
 the proviso in Part I of Proclamation No. 3040 states that unless and until the President proclaims that the circumstances set forth in the seventh recital of that proclamation no longer exist the provisions of items 705 and 706 in that Part I shall be applied as though they were stated in the manner set forth in the eighth recital of that proclamation instead of as set forth in Part I of the Schedule XX;
6. 
Whereas
 I determine that the application of the provisions of items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX as set forth therein is required or appropriate to carry out the designated trade agreement for accession; and
7. 
Whereas
 in Part I of Schedule XX annexed to the Sixth Protocol of Supplementary Concessions to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of May 23, 1956 (7 UST (pt. 2) 1400), which is a trade agreement entered into pursuant to section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, and to which effect was given by Part I of Proclamation No. 3140 of June 13, 1956 (70 Stat. C40), (a) the rate in Column C in item 776 was erroneously set forth as "0.6230 per lb." instead of "0.6250 per lb.", and (b) the ad-valorem part of the rate in Column C in item 1115(a) applicable to clothing and articles of wearing apparel valued over $4 per pound was erroneously set forth as "22%" instead of "21%":
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as now amended (19 U.S.C. 1351), do proclaim as follows:
PART I
(1) The circumstances set forth in the seventh recital of Proclamation No. 3040 of December 24, 1953, no longer exist, and
(2) To the end that the trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation may be carried out, on and after the day following the date of this proclamation the proviso in Part I of Proclamation No. 3040 shall be terminated, and items 705 and 706 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of the trade agreement for accession specified in the first recital of this proclamation shall be included in the list set forth in the ninth recital of Proclamation No. 2867 of December 22, 1949, as supplemented by subsequent proclamations.
PART II
Proclamation No. 3140 of June 13, 1956, shall be applied as though Part I of Schedule XX annexed to the trade agreement specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation had provided (a) for a rate of "0.6250 per lb." in Column C in item 776, and (b) for a rate of "37.50 per lb. and 21 % ad val." in Column C in item 1115(a), applicable to clothing and articles of wearing apparel valued over $4 per pound.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
Acting Secretary of State
