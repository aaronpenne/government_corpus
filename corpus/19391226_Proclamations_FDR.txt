By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 509 of the Sugar Act of 1937 provides, in part:
"Whenever the President finds and proclaims that a national economic or other emergency exists with respect to sugar or liquid sugar, he shall by proclamation suspend the operation of title II or III above, which he determines, on the basis of such findings, should be suspended, and, thereafter, the operation of any such title shall continue in suspense until the President finds and proclaims that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exist. . . . "; and
Whereas
 by proclamation issued September 11, 1939, I found and proclaimed that a national economic emergency existed with respect to sugar and suspended the operation of title II of that Act:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the foregoing provision of the Sugar Act of 1937, do hereby find and proclaim that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exist and do by this proclamation remove the suspension of the operation of title II of that Act with respect to the calendar year 1940.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
