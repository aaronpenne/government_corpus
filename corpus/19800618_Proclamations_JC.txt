By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The young people of America are one of our greatest natural resources, and their health and well-being are vital to the health and well-being of the Nation. The thousands of youth athletic programs run by communities, schools, and private groups all across this country promote physical fitness among our youth and more. They also give the young people of this country invaluable training in sportsmanship, fair play, and team effort. They are the training ground for those who will eventually replace us?and surpass us. 
Youth athletic programs are heavily dependent on voluntary contributions of funds and services from individuals. Thanks to the generosity of Americans throughout the United States, these programs continue to succeed in their crucial task. Such volunteers are a credit to their communities and to the Nation. 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 442, has requested the President to proclaim the week beginning June 22, 1980, as National Athletic Boosters Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 22, 1980, as National Athletic Boosters Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe it with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
