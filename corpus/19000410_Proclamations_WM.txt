A Proclamation
 
Whereas by section one of the act of July 1, 1892 (27 Stat., 62), entitled "An act to provide for the opening of a part of the Colville Reservation, in the State of Washington, and for other purposes" it is provided:
"That subject to the reservations and allotment of lands in severalty to the individual members of the Indians of the Colville Reservation in the State of Washington herein provided for, all the following described tract or portion of said Colville Reservation, namely: Beginning at a point on the eastern boundary line of the Colville Indian Reservation where the township line between townships thirty-four and thirty-five north, of range thirty-seven east, of the Willamette meridian, if extended west, would intersect the same, said point being in the middle of the channel of the Columbia river, and running thence west parallel with the forty-ninth parallel of latitude to the western boundary line of the said Colville Indian Reservation in the Okanagon river, thence north following the said western boundary line to the said forty-ninth parallel of latitude, thence east along the said forty-ninth parallel of latitude to the northeast corner of the said Colville Indian Reservation, thence south following the eastern boundary of said reservation to the place of beginning, containing by estimation one million five hundred thousand acres, the same being a portion of the Colville Indian Reservation, created by executive order dated July second, eighteen hundred and seventy-two, be, and is hereby, vacated and restored to the public domain, notwithstanding any executive order or other proceeding whereby the same was set apart as a reservation for any Indians or bands of Indians, and the same shall be open to settlement and entry by the proclamation of the President of the United States and shall be disposed of under the general laws applicable to the disposition of public lands in the State of Washington,"
and
Whereas it is provided by section three of said act,
"That each entryman under the homestead laws shall, within five years from the date of his original entry and before receiving a final certificate for the land covered by his entry, pay to the United States for the land so taken by him in addition to fees provided by law the sum of one dollar and fifty cents per acre, one third of which shall be paid within two years after the date of the original entry: but the rights of honorably discharged Union soldiers and sailors as defined and described in sections twenty-three hundred and four and twenty-three hundred and five of the Revised Statutes of the United States, shall not be abridged, except as to the sum to be paid as aforesaid,"
and
Whereas by section six of said act it is provided:
"That the land used and occupied for school purposes at what is known as Tonasket school, on Bonaparte creek, and the site of the sawmill, gristmill, and other mill property on said reservation, is hereby reserved from the operation of this act, unless other lands are selected in lieu thereof: Provided, That such reserve lands shall not exceed in the aggregate two sections, and must be selected in legal subdivisions conformably to the public surveys, such selection to be made by the Indian Agent of the Colville Agency, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior and subject to his approval: Provided, however, That said Indians may, in lieu of said sites, or either of them, select other lands of equal quantity, for such purposes, either on the vacated or unvacated portions of said reservation, the same to be designated in legal subdivisions by said Indian Agent, under the direction of and subject to the approval of the Secretary of the Interior, in which case said first-designated tracts shall not be exempt from the operation of this act; such selection to be made and approved within six months after the survey of said lands and the proclamation of the President,"
and
Whereas in a clause in the Indian Appropriation Act of July 1, 1898 (30 Stat., 571), it is provided:
"That the mineral lands only in the Colville Indian Reservation, in the State of Washington, shall be subject to entry under the laws of the United States in relation to the entry of minerals lands: Provided, That lands allotted to the Indians or used by the Government for any purpose or by any school shall not be subject to entry under this provision,"
and in another clause that,
"The Indian allotments in severalty provided for in said act shall be selected and completed at the earliest practicable time and not later than six months after the proclamation of the President opening the vacated portion of said reservation to settlement and entry, which proclamation may be issued without awaiting the survey of the unsurveyed lands therein. Said allotments shall be made from lands which shall at the time of the selection thereof be surveyed, excepting that any Indian entitled to allotment under said act who has improvements upon unsurveyed land may select the same for his allotment, whereupon the Secretary of the Interior shall cause the same to be surveyed and allotted to him. At the expiration of six months from the date of the proclamation by the President, and not before, the non-mineral lands within the vacated portion of said reservation which shall not have been allotted to Indians as aforesaid, shall be subject to settlement, entry and disposition under said act of July first, eighteen hundred and ninety-two: Provided, That the land used and occupied for school purposes at what is known as Tonasket school, on Bonaparte creek, and the site of the sawmill, gristmill and other mill property on said reservation, are hereby reserved from the operation of this act, unless other lands are selected in lieu thereof as provided in section six of the aforesaid act of July first, eighteen hundred and ninety-two,"
and
Whereas, all the terms, conditions and considerations required by said acts of July 1, 1892, and July 1, 1898, precedent to the issuance of the Proclamation provided for therein, have been, as I hereby declare, complied with:
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by the statutes hereinbefore mentioned, do hereby declare and make known that all of said lands herein-before described, restored by the said act of July 1, 1892, will, at and after the hour of twelve o'clock noon (Pacific standard time) six months from date hereof, to wit: the 10th day of October, nineteen hundred, and not before, be open to settlement and entry under the terms of and subject to all the conditions, limitations, reservations and restrictions contained in the statutes above specified, and the laws of the United States, applicable thereto, saving and excepting such tracts as have been or may be allotted to or reserved or selected for, the Indians, or other purposes, under the laws herein referred to.
Sections sixteen and thirty-six in each township will be subject to such right of the State of Washington thereto as may be ascertained and determined by the land department in the administration of the grant of lands in place to that State for the support of common schools.
The lands which have been allotted to the Indians are for greater convenience particularly described in the accompanying schedule, entitled "Schedule of lands allotted to the Indians in restored portion of Colville Reservation, Washington, and withheld from settlement and entry by proclamation of the President, dated April 10, 1900," and which schedule is made a part hereof.
Notice, moreover, is hereby given that it is by law enacted that at the expiration of six months from the date of the proclamation by the President, and not before, the non-mineral lands within the vacated portion of said reservation which shall not have been allotted to or reserved or selected for the Indians, or for other purposes, shall be subject to settlement, entry and disposition under said act of July 1, 1892; and all persons are hereby warned from attempting to make settlement on any of said lands prior to the date fixed for the opening hereof.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 10th day of April, A.D. 1900, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-fourth.
