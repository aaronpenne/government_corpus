A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the widespread occurrence of preventable accidents is a matter of national concern; and
Whereas
 experience has demonstrated the value of a concentrated effort to stress the importance of learning and conscientiously observing farm-safety rules; and
Whereas
 a wider awareness of those rules would result in a material reduction of the accident toll among farm people;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 23, 1950, as national Farm Safety Week, and I earnestly request all organizations and individuals interested in farm life and the welfare of farm people to join in a continuing campaign designed to promote the safety of workers on the farm.
I also request the United States Department of Agriculture and other appropriate Federal agencies, as well as farm and safety organizations, schools, civic groups, and all media of public information to encourage the study and observance of farm-safety rules during the designated week and throughout the year.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 11th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
