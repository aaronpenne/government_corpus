A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 during the American war for independence a young Polish patriot in exile, Count Casimir Pulaski, joined and fought brilliantly with the Continental Army, was promoted by Congress to brigadier general and commander of cavalry, and organized and commanded a corps called the Pulaski Legion; and 
Whereas
 General Pulaski died on October 11, 1779, of a wound received two days earlier while leading a cavalry charge in the city of Savannah, Georgia; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate that we should continue to take pride in General Pulaski's devotion to our Nation and to the cause of universal freedom by marling the one hundred and eighty-fifth anniversary of his death; and 
Whereas
 this occasion reminds us of the great contributions made to the progress and security of this Nation by our many citizens of Polish origin; and 
Whereas
 it is fitting that we acknowledge our debt to General Pulaski and his countrymen and honor the memory of this gallant Polish patriot. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 11, 1964, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and the noble cause for which he gave his life. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this Fifteenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
