By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Archery, which in centuries past was a major means of livelihood and warfare, today is one of the fastest growing forms of competitive sport and recreational activity in the United States.
The skills of the bow and arrow are taught in thousands of school physical education programs; archery rapidly is becoming a major intercollegiate sport; and the manufacture of archery equipment is a significant industry.
In 1972 archery will become an official Olympic sport, which is further evidence of its growing popularity and increased stature.
To give recognition to the development of archery as a major sport and to the role of the United States as host to the world archery championships this year, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 85, has requested the President to proclaim the period from August 26, 1969, through September 1, 1969, as National Archery Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from August 26 through September 1, 1969, as National Archery Week.
I invite the Governors of the States and appropriate officials of local governments to issue similar proclamations; and I urge recreational agencies, sportsmen's groups, and interested individuals to join in promoting activities which will preserve and enhance archery as an exciting and enjoyable link with mankind's past.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
