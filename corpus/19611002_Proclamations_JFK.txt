A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, the Congress has designated the eleventh of November as a legal holiday to be known as Veterans Day, and has dedicated it to the cause of world peace; and 
Whereas
, the millions of our fellow citizens, who by their wartime service in the armed forces of our nation advanced that cause, know well the value of furthering that cause today; and 
Whereas
, we, inspired by the strength of our dedication to peace in the past, can face with renewed vigor the difficult task of maintaining it in the present and in the future: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite all our citizens on Saturday, November 11, 1961, to observe Veterans Day with me in appropriate ceremonies expressive of our people's desire for peace and their gratitude to our veterans who have served and sacrificed to attain it. 
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Federal Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day. 
I also call upon officials of the Federal and State Governments and upon local officials to encourage citizens groups and agencies of the press, radio, television and motion pictures to engage in appropriate activities to deepen the meaning and observance of Veterans Day throughout the land in cooperation with the Veterans Day National Committee and other organizations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
Done at the City of Washington this second day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK,
