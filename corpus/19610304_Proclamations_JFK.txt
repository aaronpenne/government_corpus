A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 more than a million farm residents are injured and thousands are killed each year in accidents; and 
Whereas
 farm accidents bring sorrow and suffering to our farm families, and inflict heavy economic losses upon both the farm community and the Nation; and 
Whereas
 the safety of those people who produce our food is of vital concern to all of our citizens: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 23, 1961, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge all farm residents to remember that "Safety Is a Family Affair." 
I also urge all persons and organizations interested in the safety of farm people to support and participate in this special endeavor to help reduce the number of farm accidents. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred anal eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
