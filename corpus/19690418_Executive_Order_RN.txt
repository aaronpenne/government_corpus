By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 612 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2962), section 406 of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3886), and section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget is authorized to designate, from time to time, projects for joint funding under section 612 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended (42 U.S.C. 2962), and section 406 of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3886). The Director of the Bureau of the Budget is also authorized to designate, or provide criteria for the designation of, one Federal agency to act for all participating agencies in administering any such jointly funded project.
SEC. 2. Any Federal agency designated pursuant to section 1 of this order to administer any jointly funded project may waive any technical grant or contract requirement which is inconsistent with such agency's similar requirements or which such agency does not impose, except that no waiver of requirements may be made which (1) would materially affect or change the character or purpose of such project, or (2) does not have the concurrence of the agency which imposed such requirement and advanced the funds for such project. For the purposes of this section, the term "technical grant or contract requirement" means any requirement imposed by administrative regulation or order.
SEC. 3. The Director of the Bureau of the Budget is authorized to prescribe such additional regulations, not inconsistent with those prescribed herein, as he may deem necessary to implement section 612 of the Economic Opportunity Act of 1964, as amended, section 406 of the Juvenile Delinquency Prevention and Control Act of 1968, and this order.
SEC. 4. In carrying out the provisions of this order, the Director of the Bureau of the Budget shall from time to time consult with the participating Federal agencies as may be appropriate.
SEC. 5. Nothing in this order shall be deemed to limit or restrict any other authority which any Federal agency may possess by law, regulation, or order to initiate or participate in common or jointly funded projects, programs, activities, or functions.
