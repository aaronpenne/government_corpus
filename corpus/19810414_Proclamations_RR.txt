By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
By Proclamation No. 4807 of December 4, 1980, the quantity of certain peanuts permitted entry into the customs territory of the United States during a quota year was increased 200 million pounds on a temporary and emergency basis. 
The increase of quantity was to be effective pending further action; specifically, after receipt of a report of findings and recommendations of the United States International Trade Commission, which was scheduled to conduct an investigation into this matter pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624). The Commission has conducted an investigation and reported its findings and recommendations. 
On the basis of the Commission's investigation and report, I find and declare that through July 31, 1981, the entry of 300 million pounds of peanuts—which would otherwise be under the terms and conditions specified in item 951.01 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States—in addition to the quota quantity specified for such peanuts in item 951.00 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States, will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support operations now being conducted by the Department of Agriculture for peanuts, or reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from domestic peanuts with respect to which such program is now being undertaken. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim: that item 951.01 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States, as added by Proclamation No. 4807, is hereby amended by changing the figure "200 million" to read "300 million" and by changing the date "June 30, 1981" to read "July 31, 1981"; and, that section (2) of Proclamation No. 4807 is amended by changing "July 1, 1981" to read "August 1, 1981." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
