By the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by Section 2(b)(1)(B) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(b)(1)(B)), and by Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
1-101. The function vested in the President by Section 2(b) (1) (B) of the Export-Import Bank Act of 1945, as amended (12 U.S.C. 635(b) (1) (B)), is delegated to the Secretary of State. That function is the authority to determine that a denial by the Export-Import Bank of an application for credit would be in the national interest, where such action could clearly and importantly advance United States policy in such areas as international terrorism, nuclear proliferation, environmental protection and human rights. 
1-102. Before making such a determination, the Secretary of State shall consult with the Secretary of Commerce and the heads of other interested Executive agencies. 
1-103. In accord with Section 2(b) (1) (B) of that Act, only in those cases where the Secretary of State has made such a determination should the Export-Import Bank deny an application for credit for nonfinancial or noncommercial considerations.
