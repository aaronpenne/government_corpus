A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 509 of the Sugar Act of 1937 (50 Stat. 916) provides, in part:
"Whenever the President finds and proclaims that a national economic or other emergency exists with respect to sugar or liquid sugar, he shall by proclamation suspend the operation of title II or III above, which he determines, on the basis of such findings, should be suspended, and, thereafter, the operation of any such title shall continue in suspense until the President finds and proclaims that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exist.";
And Whereas
 by proclamation issued April 13, 1942 (7 F.R. 2826), the President found and proclaimed that a national economic emergency existed with respect to sugar and suspended the operation of Title II of that Act:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the foregoing provision of the Sugar Act of 1937, do hereby find and proclaim that the facts which occasioned such suspension no longer exist, and do hereby terminate such suspension of the operation of Title II of that Act.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of November in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
