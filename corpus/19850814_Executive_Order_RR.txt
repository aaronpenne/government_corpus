By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and statutes of the United States of America, including the Federal Advisory Committee Act, as amended (5 U.S.C. App. I), and in order to revise the name of a presidential advisory commission to better describe its areas of responsibility, and to extend the date within which the commission must complete its responsibilities, it is hereby ordered that Executive Order No. 12503 is amended as follows: 
The title of the Order and Section l(a) are amended by deleting "Presidential Commission on Outdoor Recreation Resources Review" and inserting in lieu thereof "President's Commission on Americans Outdoors"; and 
Section 4(b) of the Order is revised to provide as follows: 
"The Commission shall submit its report no later than December 31, 1986, and shall terminate 30 days after its report.".
