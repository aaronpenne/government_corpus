A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Craters of the Moon National Monument, Idaho, established by Proclamation No. 1694 of May 2, 1924, was reserved and set apart as an area that contains a remarkable fissure eruption together with its associated volcanic cones, craters, rifts, lava flows, caves, natural bridges, and other phenomena characteristic of volcanic action that are of unusual scientific value; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to add to the Craters of the Moon National Monument a 180-acre kipuka, a term of Hawaiian origin for an island of vegetation completely surrounded by lava, that is scientifically valuable for ecological studies because it contains a mature, native sagebrush-grassland association which has been undisturbed by man or domestic livestock; and to add to the monument the intervening lands between the kipuka and the present monument boundaries: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C. 431), and subject to valid existing rights do proclaim that the following described lands are hereby added to and reserved as a part of the Craters of the Moon National Monument:

In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
