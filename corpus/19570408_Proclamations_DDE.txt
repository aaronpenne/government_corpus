A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the destiny of the Nation depends in large part upon the health and welfare of its children; and
Whereas
 it is therefore appropriate that we dedicate ourselves anew to the task of promoting the spiritual, emotional, and physical well-being of our children; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day and calling for the appropriate observance of that day; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day is also a fitting time for the people of the United States to observe a Universal Children's Day, and to salute the work which the United Nations, through its specialized agencies, and the United Nations Children's Fund are doing to build better health for children:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, the first day of May 1957, as Child Health Day; and I invite all persons and all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to unite on that day in observances that will emphasize the importance of a year-round program designed to protect and develop the health of all children.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 8th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
