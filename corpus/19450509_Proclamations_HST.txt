A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Nation recognizes that the skill and labor of its farmers is a vital factor in winning the war, and the production of food one of the most essential means of winning the peace; and
Whereas
 the inevitable decrease in available farm labor this year creates an especially urgent need for conserving farm manpower to meet production goals in 1945; and
Whereas
 the accidents which cause some fourteen hundred farm residents to lose their lives each month, and one hundred and twenty-five thousand others to suffer injuries, constitute an unnecessary waste of human life as well as of time and material:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week commencing July 22, 1945, as National Farm-Safety Week. And I request all persons and organizations concerned with agriculture and farm life to do everything in their power to educate farm people in the proper precautions by which they may eliminate farm hazards, and to stimulate a nationwide determination to stop the needless waste of irreplaceable farm manpower and property. And I further urge that farm people everywhere observe National Farm-Safety Week by making a safety check in their homes and on their farms.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and sixty-ninth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JOSEPH C. GREW,
Acting Secretary of State.
