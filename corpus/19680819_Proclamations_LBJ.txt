By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On October 11, 1779, Brigadier General Casimir Pulaski died from wounds received during the siege of Savannah, Georgia. His death ended a career of brilliant leadership and courage in the service of freedom and independence.
He was not born in the land he learned to love so well. As a young man in exile from his own country, Count Pulaski joined the Continental Army, was appointed a brigadier general and commander of cavalry, and distinguished himself in the battles of Brandywine and Germantown. He raised and commanded a corps known as the Pulaski Legion.
On November 29, 1779, the Continental Congress, in recognition of his service and sacrifice, resolved that a monument should be erected to this brave son of Poland.
On the one hundred and eighty-ninth anniversary of his death, it is fitting that we commemorate General Pulaski for his devotion to our Nation, as a continuing example to all men who strive toward the goals of freedom and justice.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America do hereby designate Friday, October 11, 1968, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools, churches, and other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
