WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between certain ship owners and operators in the United States foreign and domestic trades and certain of their employees represented by: the Sailors' Union of the Pacific; Pacific Coast Marine Firemen, Oilers, Watertenders and Wipers Association; and the Marine Cooks and Stewards Union; and 
WHEREAS, such dispute has resulted in a strike which, in my opinion, affects a substantial part of the maritime industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, and transportation among the several States and with foreign nations, and which strike will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety: 
NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155, (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of Professor James J. Healy, Chairman, Professor Frank J. Dugan, and Honorable Laurence E. Seibel as members to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute. 
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of such Act on or before April 11, 1962. 
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
