By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American heritage of individual freedom and of Government deriving its powers from the consent of the governed has from the time of the Fathers of our Republic been proudly transmitted to each succeeding generation, and to us of this generation has fallen the task of preserving it and transmitting it to the future. We are now engaged in a mighty effort to fortify that heritage.
Mindful of our duties in the family of nations we have endeavored to prevent the outbreak and the spread of war, and we have raised our voices against international injustice. As Americans and as lovers of freedom we are humbly sympathetic with those who are facing tribulation in lands across the seas. When every succeeding day brings sad news of suffering and disaster abroad we are especially conscious of the Divine Power and of our dependence upon God's merciful guidance. With this consciousness in our hearts it is seemly that we should, at a time like this, pray to Almighty God for His blessing on our country and for the establishment of a just and permanent peace among all the nations of the world. 
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Sunday, September 8, 1940, as a day of prayer; and I urge the people of the United States, of all creeds and denominations, to pray on that day, in their churches or at their homes, on the high seas or wherever they may be, beseeching the Ruler of the Universe to bless our Republic, to make us reverently grateful for our heritage and firm in its defense, and to grant to this land and to the troubled world a righteous, enduring peace.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
