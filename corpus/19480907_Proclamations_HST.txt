By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 411 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, approved June 19, 1934, authorizes the President to prescribe and from time to time change the tolls that shall be levied by the Government of the United States for the use of the Panama Canal, and provides that no tolls when so prescribed shall be changed unless six months' notice thereof is given by the President by proclamation; and 
Whereas
 increased tolls were prescribed by Proclamation No. 2775 of March 26, 1948, the same proclamation to become effective on October 1, 1948; and
Whereas
 it now appears that the Congress may be called upon to give consideration to the entire question of the cost of operation of the Panama Canal and the tolls to be levied for the use thereof; and
Whereas
 it appears consistent with the public interest to postpone the effective date of the said Proclamation No. 2775 until April 1, 1949, so as to permit continuance of the present tolls until the Congress shall have had opportunity for such consideration:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid section 411 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, do hereby proclaim that the effective date of the said Proclamation No. 2775 of March 26, 1948, is postponed to, and shall be, April 1, 1949.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this seventh day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
