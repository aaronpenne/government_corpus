By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 The Medicine Bow Forest Reserve, in the State of Wyoming, was established by proclamation dated May twenty-second, nineteen hundred and two, under and by virtue of section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes", which provides, "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas,
 it is further provided by the Act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes", that "the President is hereby authorized at any time to modify any Executive order that has been or may hereafter be made establishing any forest reserve, and by such modification may reduce the area or change the boundary lines of such reserve, or may vacate altogether any order creating such reserve"; under which provision the boundary lines of the said forest reserve were changed and enlarged by proclamation dated July sixteenth, nineteen hundred and two;
And Whereas,
 it appears that the public good would be promoted by including within the said forest reserve certain additional lands in the State of Colorado which are in part covered with timber;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid act of Congress, approved June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, do hereby make known and proclaim that the boundary lines of the aforesaid Medicine Bow Forest Reserve are hereby further modified so as to read as follows:
