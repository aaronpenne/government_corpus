The requirement of the United States citizenship is hereby waived to permit the certification of Mr. Cedric R. Landon for appointment to the position of predatory animal inspector, Bureau of Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, for service in the State of Texas. Mr. Landon was born in Canada in 1887, was in Texas for a while during his minority, and declared his intention of becoming a citizen of the United States on November 13, 1914. He had been serving temporarily in the position to which appointment is desired, and was admitted to examination conditionally and passed with a rating of 84.75 but can not be certified under existing rules. 
The Secretary of Agriculture states that Mr. Landon has had charge of a force of about a dozen hunter-trappers, is a good executive, energetic, resourceful, very tactful in dealing with stockmen with whom he comes in contact, well qualified to handle the accounts and correspondence incident to his position, and very successful in instructing individual hunters. These qualifications together with his intimate knowledge of the country and local conditions (almost indispensable requirements for an inspector) are said to make his services very desirable, particularly in the sparsely settled regions of central and western Texas. He is the only competitor from the section of the country where he is employed. 
This order is issued on the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture with the concurrence of the Civil Service Commission.
