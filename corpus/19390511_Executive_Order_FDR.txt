EXECUTIVE ORDER 8130

May 11, 1939
IDAHO
By virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 11, 36 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 473), and upon the recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, it is ordered that all lands now comprising the Pocatello and Portneuf Divisions of the Cache National Forest, Idaho, be, and they are hereby, transferred to the Caribou National Forest, Idaho.
It is not intended by this order to give any publicly-owned lands a national- forest status which have not hitherto had such status, or to remove any publicly-owned lands from a national-forest status.
