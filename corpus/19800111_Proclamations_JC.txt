By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
At a time when freedom is once again under challenge around the world, we will remember George Meany. We will remember him as the symbol of a vibrant free trade union movement. We will remember him as the champion of the highest values of our democracy. In a career that exceeded a half century, George Meany changed the shape of America for the better in hundreds of ways, great and small, through the force of his character and through the integrity of his beliefs. 
The modern American labor movement-strong, united and free?is George Meany's enduring legacy to our Nation. It is proper and fitting that we honor his memory today and that we remember his many contributions to our Nation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me as Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces (36 U.S.C. 178) do hereby proclaim that, as a mark of respect to the memory of George Meany and his numerous contributions to our Nation, the flag of the United States shall be flown at halfstaff on all buildings, grounds and naval vessels of the Federal government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its territories and possessions until his interment. 
I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
