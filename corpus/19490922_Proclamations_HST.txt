A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 men of good will everywhere are seeking the way to a new world, in which lasting peace will prevail and all nations will work and live together in friendly accord; and
Whereas
 all who have this hope may draw inspiration and courage from the superb resolution and infinite faith of Christopher Columbus, who found a new world beyond uncharted seas; and
Whereas
, in appreciation of the achievement of Columbus in discovering this new world of opportunity, the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, October 12, 1949, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day with ceremonies commemorative of the anniversary of the sighting of land by Columbus and his crew on their westward voyage in 1492. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this the 22d day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
