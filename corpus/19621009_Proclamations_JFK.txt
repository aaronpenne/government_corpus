A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the National School Lunch Act was enacted as a measure of national security, to safeguard the health and well-being of the Nation's children and to encourage the domestic consumption of nutritious agricultural commodities and other food, by assisting the States, through grants-in-aid and other means, in providing an adequate supply of foods and other facilities for the establishment, maintenance, operation, and expansion of nonprofit school-lunch programs; and 
Whereas
 the school-lunch program is essentially a community effort, depending on the interest and support of every citizen; and 
Whereas
, in order to encourage our citizens and civic groups to lend assistance to the school-lunch program, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved October 9, 1962, has designated the seven-day period beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 14, 1962, as National School Lunch Week, with ceremonies and activities designed to encourage our citizens and civic groups to extend every effort in support of the school-lunch program. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
