By virtue of the authority vested in me by the statutes, including section 2 of the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403), the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, approved June 27, 1944 (58 Stat. 387), and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (5 U.S.C. 631), it is hereby ordered as follows:
In civil service examinations for the position of Substitute Railway Postal Clerk competition shall be restricted, until July 25, 1952, to persons entitled to preference under the said Veterans' Preference Act of 1944, as long as persons entitled to preference are available: Provided, however, that for purposes of classification application for examination may be accepted by the Civil Service Commission from any person who has been serving in such position continuously since the date of this order under an appointment not limited to one year or less, and the Commission is authorized to confer a competitive civil service status or a probational status upon any such employee who qualifies in the examination for classification: And provided further that in no event shall any person not entitled to preference under the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944 be granted a competitive civil service status or a probational status under this order (1) unless he is recommended for this purpose by the Postmaster General and (2) until all preference eligibles who have the same or a higher rating in the examination have been appointed or have been given consideration in accordance with the Veterans' Preference Act of 1944.
Incumbents of positions to which this order is applicable who do not have a competitive status and who fail to qualify for a competitive civil service status or a probational status under this order shall be replaced by selection from the competitive register in accordance with the regulations prescribed by the Civil Service Commission.
