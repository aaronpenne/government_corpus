By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Quantitative limitations previously have been imposed on the importation of certain cheeses pursuant to the provisions of Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624). Section 701 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979, Public Law 96-39, provides that the President shall by proclamation limit the quantity of quota cheeses specified therein which may enter the United States in any calendar year after 1979 to not more than 111,000 metric tons. 
2. By Proclamation No. 5618 of March 16, 1987, the quantitative limitations in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) were modified to reflect the Government of Portugal's accessions to the European Economic Community (EEC). The quota allocations previously made to Portugal were transferred to the European Economic Community. Proclamation No. 5618 also implemented certain undertakings to the EEC. 
3. Due to a technical error, Proclamation No. 5618 failed to delete the quota for Portugal for certain cheeses under TSUS Item 950.10D, while transferring that quota to the EEC. Accordingly, I have determined that a technical correction is appropriate. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including Section 701 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 and Section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act of 1933, as amended, do hereby proclaim that, effective upon signature of this Proclamation, part 3 of the Appendix for the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) is modified as follows:
TSUS Item 950.10D is modified by deleting the line beginning with "Portugal". 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
