A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross is officially designated by the Congress to act in matters of voluntary relief for uniformed personnel of the Armed Forces and their families; and 
Whereas
 this vital contribution to national morale must necessarily be expanded whenever world tension requires a substantial increase in the strength of our armed services; and 
Whereas
, under Federal laws and regulations, the Red Cross renders emergency aid to victims of disaster and assists with the recovery and rehabilitation of those in need of help in the wake of those disasters; and 
Whereas
, together with eighty-six other societies affiliated in the League of Red Cross Societies, the American Red Cross participates in a program of international relief, and in concert with those societies provides technical assistance to other members of the world-wide Red Cross organization; and 
Whereas
 the American Red Cross and its local chapters carry on programs of training in first aid and home nursing and engage in the collection and distribution of blood both of which services make an important contribution to the general welfare of the American people and, more particularly, are an essential part of the National Emergency Preparedness activities of this Nation; and 
and 
Whereas
 these essential services are voluntarily rendered to the Government of the United States and the American people by the members and volunteers of the Red Cross: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1962 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to donor the Red Cross during that month by supporting it as a channel of humanitarian assistance for their neighbors in need. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
