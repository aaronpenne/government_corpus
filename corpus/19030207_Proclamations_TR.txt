A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 a proclamation was issued February 10, 1890, by the President making known and proclaiming the acceptance of the Sioux Act approved March 2, 1889 (25 Stats., 888) by the different bands of the Sioux Nation of Indians, and the consent thereto by them as required by the said act;
And Whereas,
 the proclamation contains the following clause:
That there is also reserved as aforesaid the following described tract within which the Cheyenne River Agency, school and certain other buildings are located, to wit: Commencing at a point in the center of the main channel of the Missouri River opposite Deep Creek, about three miles south of the Cheyenne River; thence due west five and one half miles; thence due north to the Cheyenne River; thence down said river by the center of the main channel thereof to a point in the center of the Missouri River due east or opposite the mouth of said Cheyenne River; thence down the center of the main channel of the Missouri River to the place of beginning:
And Whereas,
 the government agency and school buildings have been removed from the lands as above indicated to their present locations;
And Whereas,
 there appears to be no reason for continuing the lands in a state of reservation, the same not being needed for Indian purposes;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested do hereby declare the said lands subject to disposal under the provisions of the said act, except 160 acres of land to which the St. Johns Mission School has obtained title under the Sioux Act mentioned, in accordance with the provisions thereof.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
