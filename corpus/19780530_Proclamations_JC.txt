By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American flag has grown and changed with the Nation. But for two hundred years, the United States remained unchanging in its commitment to the ideals which gave birth to that flag. 
To commemorate the anniversary of the adoption on June 14, 1777 by the Continental Congress of the Stars and Stripes as the official flag of the United States of America, the Congress has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of the fourteenth day of June of each year as Flag Day and the week in which that day occurs as National Flag Week (36 U.S.C. 157 and 157a). 
To encourage the American people to reflect upon their Nation, its heritage, and its course in the years ahead, the Congress, by joint resolution of June 13, 1975, has set aside the twenty-one days from Flag Day through Independence Day as a period to honor America (36 U.S.C. 157b). 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the American people to observe June 14, 1978 as Flag Day and the week beginning June 11, 1978 as National Flag Week. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag on all Government buildings during that week and ask the American people to display our flag at their homes and other suitable places for the same period. 
I also ask each American to observe the period from Flag Day through Independence Day as a period to honor America. To that end, I ask all Americans to participate in local activities that reflect an understanding and appreciation of America and its institutions. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
