By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Throughout this century, the United States has been the world's leader in high technology innovation and development. Because the economy of this Nation closely is tied to technological advances, maintenance of this leadership is a national priority. Americans must build on our unmatched body of technical knowledge and on our entrepreneurial spirit to bring new and competitive products to the market. 
Our youth are the key to maintaining this leadership. Young Americans must receive the educational opportunities necessary to grow and develop in a high technology environment. By providing these opportunities, our national commitment to high technology development will be translated into real progress benefitting future generations. 
To focus public attention on the importance of high technology development, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 453, has designated the week of September 30 through October 6, 1984, as "National High-Tech Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of September 30 through October 6, 1984, as National High-Tech Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to celebrate this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
