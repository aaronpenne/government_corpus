A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 certain changes in the tolls for the use of the Panama Canal were prescribed by Proclamation No. 2775 of March 26, 1948, under the authority of section 411 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, approved June 19, 1934, such proclamation to become effective on October 1, 1948; and

Whereas
 the act entitled "An act to authorize and provide for the maintenance and operation of the Panama Canal by the present corporate adjunct of the Panama Canal, as renamed; to reconstitute the agency charged with the civil government of the Canal Zone, and for other purposes," approved by me this date, authorizes the Panama Canal Company (created by such act) to prescribe and from time to time change the tolls that shall be levied for the use of the Panama Canal and provides that the existing rates of tolls shall continue in effect until changed as provided for therein:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,

In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 26th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth.
