A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 one of the great challenges of our age is man's struggle to sustain individual freedom, human dignity, and justice for all; and 
Whereas
 one of the vital bulwarks in that struggle is the rule of law which underlies our whole social, economic and governmental structure, and through which we strive constantly to broaden and secure for all our citizens the rights and opportunities guaranteed by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights; and 
Whereas
 the strengthening of the rule of law in our own country directly concerns every citizen because it is of fundamental importance both to the nation's welfare at home and to our hopes for building an enduring structure of world peace through wider application of the rule of law in relations between nations; and 
Whereas
, just as freedom itself demands constant vigilance, it is essential that we nurture through education and example an appreciation of the values of our system of justice and that we foster through improved understanding of the function of law and of independent courts an increased respect for law and for the rights of others as basic elements of our free society; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 7, 1961, 75 Stat. 43, has designated the, first day of May of each year as Law Day, U.S.A.; has called upon the American people to rededicate themselves to "the ideals of equality and justice under law in their relations with each other as well as with other nations" and to cultivate "that respect for law that is so vital to the democratic way of life"; and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for appropriate observance of that day: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that the people of the United States observe Tuesday, May 1, 1962, with appropriate programs and ceremonies in recognition of Law Day, U.S.A. l especially urge that the schools, civic and service organizations, public bodies, the legal profession and the media of information participate in this worthy educational undertaking. I also call upon public officials to cause the flag of the United States to be displayed on all government buildings on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 16th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
