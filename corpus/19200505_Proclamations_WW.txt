A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it appears that because of droughts and adverse weather conditions many purchasers and entrymen under Proclamation of September 28, 1914 (38 Stat., 2029), and under Proclamation of April 6, 1917 (40 Stat., 1653 ), of lands in the ceded portion of the Crow Indian Reservation, Montana, are unable to make payment of the  required installments of purchase money, it is hereby ordered and directed that additional time for the payment of sums now due and unpaid be allowed until the 1921 anniversaries of the dates of the sales and entries to all such purchasers and entrymen who, within sixty days from receipt of notice to be given them by the Register and Receiver of the district land office, make payment to the Receiver of such land office of interest on the amounts in arrears, from the dates when the amounts became due, to the said anniversaries, at the rate of five per centum per annum. The said officers will promptly serve notice on all such purchasers and entrymen of the extension of time for payments herein authorized, and that if such extension is not secured within sixty days from receipt of notice, by the payment of interest as herein provided, or if within such time payment is not made, without interest, of all sums in arrears, the said purchases and entries will be reported by them to the General Land Office for cancellation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 in the District of Columbia this 5th day of May, in the year of our Lord Nineteen Hundred and twenty and of the Independence of the United States, the One Hundred and Forty-fourth.
