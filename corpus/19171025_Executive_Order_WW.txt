Newspaper readers and translators selected by the Postmaster General for filling certain confidential positions under the Trading with the Enemy Act may be appointed during the period of the war with Germany without examination under the civil service law. The Postmaster General states that there are available to the Post Office Department for appointment in these lines men whose loyalty has been proven and who in some cases will accept employment at a nominal salary through patriotic desire to give service at this time. 
The Civil Service Commission concurs in the issuance of this order in view of the highly confidential character of the employments and the particular qualifications required.
