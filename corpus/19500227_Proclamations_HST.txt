A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Armed Forces of the United States serve the Nation with courage and devotion both in war and in peace; and
Whereas
 the Armed Forces, as a unified team, are currently performing, at home and across the seas, tasks vital to the security of the nation and to the Establishment of a durable peace4; and
Whereas
 it is fitting and proper that we devote one day each year to paying tribute to the Armed Forces as the servants and protectors of our Nation:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that Saturday, May 20, 1950, shall be known as Armed Forces Day; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions to issue proclamations calling for the celebration of that day in such manner as to honor the Armed Forces of the United States and the millions of veterans who have returned to civilian pursuits.
As Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces of the United States, I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to mark the designated day with appropriate ceremonies, and to cooperate with civil authorities and civic bodies in suitable observances.
I call upon my fellow citizens to display the flag of the United States at their homes on Armed Forces Day and to participate in exercises expressive of our recognition of the skill, gallantry, and uncompromising devotion to duty characteristic of the Armed Forces in the carrying out of their missions.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
