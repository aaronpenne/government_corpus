A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 needless accidents continue to kill thousands of farm people each year; and
Whereas
 accidents injured more than a million and a quarter farm residents last year; and
Whereas
 these tragic losses are reducing America's strength in a period of great crisis:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the Nation to observe the week beginning July 19 as National Farm Safety Week, and I urgently request every farm resident to cooperate in an all-out effort to make 1953 as accident-free as possible. To the end that American farm people may "Farm To Live and Live To Farm," I request all organizations and persons interested in farm life to join in a campaign to prevent accidents on the farm, on the highway, in the home, or wherever they may occur.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
