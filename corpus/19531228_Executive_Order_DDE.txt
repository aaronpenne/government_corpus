WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and

The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the said dispute within thirty days from the date of this order.
As provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the Akron, Canton and Youngstown Railroad Company and other carriers represented by the Eastern, Western and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees or their employees in the conditions out of which the said disputes arose.
