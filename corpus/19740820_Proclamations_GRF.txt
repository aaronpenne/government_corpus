By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On Columbus Day, 1974, we again celebrate the historic achievement of the Italian sea captain whose courage and determination led him across uncharted oceans to a New World. 
Sailing in the service of the Spanish crown, the voyage of Christopher Columbus marked one of history's most challenging and rewarding explorations. He opened this continent to the migration of settlers who created an enduring nation. The United States of America still carries forth his spirit of exploration as part of its national heritage. 
Americans of the twentieth century strive to follow the vision and unshakeable faith of Christopher Columbus by seeking to discover a "New World" of peace and cooperation among all men. 
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), as modified by the act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 14, 1974, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer. 
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
