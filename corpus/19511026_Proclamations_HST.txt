A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the signing of the Armistice on the eleventh day of November, 1918, marked the triumph of the forces of freedom over imperialist aggression in World War I, and raised the hopes of mankind for a world of peace and security; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a concurrent resolution of June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies, and by an act of May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), declared that November 11 should be a legal holiday and should be known as Armistice Day; and
Whereas
 before the wounds inflicted by the First World War had fully healed armed aggression occurred again in World War II, and has once more been loosed by the Communist onslaught in Korea; and
Whereas
 the abolition of international lawlessness remains a goal to which the United States is sincerely dedicated:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request the people of this Nation to observe Sunday, November 11, 1951, as Armistice Day, by public and private ceremonies designed not only to honor those who strove so valiantly for victory and peace in 1918, and all other Americans who have fought for our freedom, but also to express our renewed prayers for the establishment of permanent peace. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Armistice Day, in memory of our heroes.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 26th day of October in the year off our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
