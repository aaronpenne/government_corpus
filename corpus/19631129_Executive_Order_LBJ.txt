WHEREAS President John F. Kennedy lighted the imagination of our people when he set the moon as our target and man as the means to reach it; and 
WHEREAS the installations now to be renamed are a center and symbol of our country's peaceful assault on space; and 
WHEREAS it is in the nature of this assault that it should test the limits of our youth and grace, our strength and wit, our vigor and perseverance--qualities fitting to the memory of John F. Kennedy: 
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, I hereby designate the facilities of the Launch Operations Center of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the facilities of Station No. 1 of the Atlantic Missile Range, in the State of Florida, as the John F. Kennedy Space Center; and such facilities shall be hereafter known and referred to by that name.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
