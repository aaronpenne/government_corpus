A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is fitting that the people of this Nation should remember with pride and vigilantly guard the great heritage of liberty, justice, and equality under law which our forefathers bequeathed to us; and
Whereas
 it is our moral and civic obligation, as free men and as Americans, to preserve and strengthen that great heritage; and
Whereas
 the principle of guaranteed fundamental rights of individuals under the law is the heart and sinew of our Nation, and distinguishes our governmental system from the type of government that rules by might alone; and
Whereas
 o u r Government has served as an inspiration and a beacon light for oppressed peoples of the world seeking freedom, Justice, and equality for the individual under laws; and
Whereas
 universal application of the principle of the rule of law in the settlement of international disputes would greatly enhance the cause of a Just and enduring peace; and
Whereas
 a day of national dedication to the principle of government under laws would afford us an opportunity better to understand and appreciate the manifold virtues of such a government and to focus the attention of the world upon them:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, May 1, 1958, as Law Day.
I urge the people of the United States to observe the designated day with appropriate ceremonies and activities; and I especially urge the legal profession, the press, and the radio, television, and motion-picture industries to promote and to participate in the observance of that day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
