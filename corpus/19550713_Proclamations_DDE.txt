Whereas
 John Marshall, soldier, diplomat, legislator, and fourth Chief Justice of the United States, played a vital role in the strengthening of our constitutional form of government; and
Whereas
 his long and distinguished term of office as Chief Justice, from 1801 to 1835, was marked by precedent-setting decisions which have been important factors in developing and maintaining the historic liberties of the people of the United States; and
Whereas
 a wider public knowledge and appreciation of the work and achievements of the great Chief Justice are desirable today in order to strengthen the moral, social, and political structure of our Nation, and to help in the preservation and protection of the lives, liberties, and property of all our people; and
