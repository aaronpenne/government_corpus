By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Schoolbus transportation serves a very special and important segment of this Nationâ€” our children. More than twenty-two million youngsters use school buses to get to school. 
When we consider the millions of young people who are transported and the millions of trips school buses make each year, we can take great pride in our safety record. Nevertheless, we must reaffirm our commitment to providing the safest possible transportation for our children. They are our most important resource, and their safe transport is and deserves to be one of our highest priorities. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with House Joint Resolution 486, do hereby proclaim the week of October 3, 1982, through October 9, 1982, as National Schoolbus Safety Week of 1982. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate activities in their homes, schools, and communities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 5th day of Oct., in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
