A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 encouraging progress has been made in the last decade in cancer research, in the improvement and expansion of the Nation's cancer facilities and services, and in the education of people to be on the alert for the early signs and symptoms of cancer; and
Whereas
 the activities responsible for this progress have been carried on by both public and private agencies and have resulted in the prolongation of lives and the mitigation of suffering; and
Whereas
 the progress so far made in our fight against cancer supports our hope that science will one day conquer this disease as it has so many others; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April as Cancer Control Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1953 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the press, and the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, as well as all other interested agencies and individuals, to unite during April 1953 in public dedication to a program for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-seventh day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
