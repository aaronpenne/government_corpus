A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 experience has revealed the great value of effective community fire prevention programs in conserving our national treasures of life and property; and 
Whereas
 increased fire losses during the past year demand an immediate awareness on the part of the public of the need for, and value of, exercising greater care and responsibility in avoiding destructive fires and for participating in community fire prevention programs and related activities: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 7, 1962, as Fire Prevention Week. 
I bid all citizens to join in actively promoting the fire prevention and control efforts of their respective community fire departments, and I especially invoke the wholehearted support of State and local governments, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the American National Red Cross, and other labor, business, farm, and professional organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies, in observing Fire Prevention Week and in enlisting the public as active participants in fire prevention efforts. I also direct the appropriate Federal agencies to assist in this effort to reduce the shameful waste caused by preventable fires: 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighteenth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
DEAN RUSK, 
Secretary of State
