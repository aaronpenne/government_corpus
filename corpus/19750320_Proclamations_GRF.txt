By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The earth will continue to regenerate its life sources only as long as we and all the peoples of the world do our part to conserve its natural resources. It is a responsibility which every human being shares. 
Energy problems have heightened our growing awareness of the interdependence of our natural resources. We must work together to solve the environmental issues associated with the proper use and preservation of those resources. 
Through voluntary action, each of us can join in building a productive land in harmony with nature. 
By a joint resolution, the Congress has pointed out the need to continue our environmental education and to promote a greater understanding of the environmental problems facing America. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, March 21, 1975, as Earth Day. I call upon all concerned citizens and government officials to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. I ask that special attention be given to personal voluntary activities and educational efforts directed toward protecting and enhancing our lifegiving environment. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
