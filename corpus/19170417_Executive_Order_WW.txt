In view of the confidential nature of the work of the Council of National Defense and its importance to the Government in the crisis which has arisen, the Council is authorized to employ for the period of the war, without reference to the requirements of the civil service law and rules, such persons as in the judgment of those in responsible charge are best adapted to its work, it being understood that all possible use will be made of the registers of the Civil Service Commission. 
The Civil Service Commission recommends the issuance of this order.
