By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
This year, more Americans than ever before will enjoy the challenges and pleasures of boating on our country's lakes, rivers, and coastal waters. If they take time to learn the fundamentals of boating safety, needless tragedy can be avoided. 
In recognition of the growth in recreational boating, and of our continuing need to promote safety on our waterways, the Congress has by joint resolution of June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179, 36 U.S.C. 161) requested the President to proclaim the week of July 4 each year as National Safe Boating Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 3, 1977, as National Safe Boating Week 
I urge everyone who participates in boating on American waterways to learn the basic rules of safety. This information is readily available in courses offered by such organizations as the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States Power Squadrons, the American Red Cross, and by various agencies of state governments. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of .Columbia, to provide appropriately for the observance of the Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
