A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 four hundred and seventy years ago Christopher Columbus set sail from Spain into an unknown sea on a voyage to increase the opportunities for commerce and on October 12, 1492, sighted the land of a new world; and 
Whereas
 his westward course was followed by millions of others from the Old World who came with the same enterprising spirit to build this Nation and other nations in this hemisphere, and to create an indestructible bond between the two hemispheres which continues to grow closer and stronger as a result of both the increasing dangers and constructive opportunities of our modern age; and 
Whereas
 in our own uncertain world Columbus' courage and strength of conviction inspire us as we work toward world community among all nations based upon the principles of a lasting peace, freedom, justice, and the dignity of man; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, in recognition of our indebtedness to Christopher Columbus, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 12, 1962, as Columbus Day. 
I direct the appropriate officers of the Federal Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day; and I request the appropriate officers of the State and local governments likewise to display the flag on that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of Christopher Columbus and his daring achievement. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
