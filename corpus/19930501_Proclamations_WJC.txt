By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
"Loyalty Day" is an occasion on which we reaffirm our allegiance to our country and our devotion to the ideals on which it was founded. Our government "by the people" respects and protects the natural rights and freedoms of all citizens, without favor, and deserves our abiding fidelity.
For more than 200 years, people from around the world have immigrated to America, bringing their dreams and aspirations to a country that prides itself on its democratic ideals. There is no greater testament to the success of our system of governance than people's desire to be a part of the great American experiment. Our Founders designed that system on the principles of individual liberties and rights of self-determination. Our Nation stands as a beacon of hope for all those who embrace these ideas.
Generations of Americans have demonstrated loyalty and devotion to their country and have gone to great lengths to preserve their freedom. Many have fought and died so that future generations could continue the proud traditions of our Nation. To acknowledge this loyalty and love of country, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369; 36 U.S.C. 162), has designated May 1 of each year as "Loyalty Day."
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1993, as Loyalty Day. I call upon all Americans to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities, including public recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance to the Flag of the United States. I also call upon government officials to display the flag on all government buildings and grounds on this day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventeenth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
