A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it has become customary on one day of each year to unite our hearts in public celebration of the common bond of humanity which we share in the memory and enjoyment of a mother's love, a mother's training, and a mother's care; and
Whereas
 it is especially appropriate this year after the achievement of victory on a thousand momentous fields of battle that we express the debt of gratitude which each of us owes to his own mother and which we all owe to the mothers of America; and
Whereas
 by Public Resolution 25, 63d Congress, approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), the second Sunday in May is designated as Mother's Day, and the President is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 12, 1946, be observed as Mother's Day with Public and private expressions of honor, reverence, and love; and I call upon the officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day and the people of the United States to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places as a public expression of honor for the mothers of this country.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
