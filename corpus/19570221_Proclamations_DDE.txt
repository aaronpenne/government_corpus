A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on April 14, 1890, the American Republics founded a bureau for inter-American cooperation which now, as the Pan American Union, is an organ and the general secretariat of the Organization of American States; and
Whereas
 the twenty-one Republics of the Western Hemisphere will celebrate April 14, 1957, the sixty-seventh anniversary of that historic action, as Pan American Day, at the end of a week of commemorative ceremonies; and
Whereas
 the American Republics continue to work together harmoniously in furtherance of their mutual objective of making the Organization of American States an increasingly effective instrument of Hemispheric solidarity; and
Whereas
 they also continue steadfast in their common determination to maintain their freedom and safeguard their peace through active participation in this Organization, which embodies our inter-American system of cooperation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, April 14, 1957, as Pan American Day, and the period from April 8 to April 14, 1957, as Pan American Week; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States of America and the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico to issue similar proclamations.
I also urge all our citizens and all interested organizations to join in appropriate observance of Pan American Day and Pan American Week, in testimony of the steadfast friendship which unites the people of the United States with the people of the other American Republics.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
