A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 a noble deed remembered and cherished generation after generation by a whole people merits the reward of official public notice; and
Whereas
 the people of our Nation recall vividly and with thanks, among the selfless deeds of those who won our independence, the supreme contribution made by Count Casimir Pulaski, a fearless Polish patriot who gallantly fought for American liberty; and
Whereas
 October 11 is the anniversary of the day in 1779 when Count Pulaski, who held the rank of Brigadier General, laid down his life in that momentous cause, having two days earlier been wounded in a cavalry charge near Savannah, Georgia:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, by this proclamation designate Saturday, October 11, 1947, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; I invite the people of the United States to observe the day in civic ceremonies; and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to have the American flag flown from all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
