A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the impact of cancer upon this country results in the loss of nearly a quarter of a million lives annually, the suffering and incapacitation of hundreds of thousands of our citizens, and the serious lowering of our national productivity; and
Whereas
 protection against this threat to the vitality of the Nation through the cooperative effort of both private and public organizations is necessary to the welfare of our people; and
Whereas
 it is incumbent upon all of us to encourage and support the efforts of the official agencies and voluntary groups engaged in research to increase knowledge of cancer, and in programs for the application of this knowledge to the problem of control of cancer through early diagnosis and effective treatment; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1955 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the press, the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, and all interested agencies and individuals, to unite during the appointed month in public dedication to programs for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 25th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
