A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the people of the United States and the people of many other countries are striving together through the United Nations to put down unprovoked and lawless aggression in Korea; and
Whereas
 millions of men, women, and children in Korea have been driven from their homes and are suffering grievously from this wanton aggression; and
Whereas
 American Relief for Korea, Incorporated, has been established by many civic, labor, and church groups as a national organization to assist in the nation-wide voluntary collection of clothing and kindred supplies for shipment to Korea; and
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States by joint Resolution has expressed deep sympathy for the plight of the unfortunate Korean refugees and, in recognition of their desperate condition, has expressed the hope and expectation that all Americans will respond generously to the appeals of American Relief for Korea, Incorporated, and has authorized the President to set aside a period of time for intensive effort to meet these appeals:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside and proclaim the month of September, 1951, as a special period of intensive effort during the course of which, as an additional sincere and tangible gesture of American friendship and sympathy, the clothing collection appeal of American Relief for Korea, Incorporated, may receive the utmost support of all Americans. I call upon our citizens, our schools, our churches, and all our civic and patriotic organizations to respond promptly and bountifully to the appeals of American Relief for Korea, Incorporated, and its associated agencies, for clothing and kindred supplies for the people of Korea.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 31st day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES E. WEBB,
