By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Many communities throughout the Nation are protected from the scourge of fire only by the courage and dedication of volunteer firemen.
These men—from all walks of life—give countless hours of their time not only in preventing and fighting fires but in educating and training themselves for this purpose, in maintaining fire-fighting equipment, and in rendering other emergency services.
It is only fitting that we pay tribute to our volunteer firemen who serve their communities night and day, often at great personal risk and sacrifice. To this end, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 1151 has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating National Volunteer Firemen's Week from October 24 to October 31, 1970.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period of October 24 to October 31, 1970, as National Volunteer Firemen's Week; and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with ceremonies and activities designed to honor our volunteer firemen for their contributions in safeguarding the lives and property of their fellow Americans.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
