By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 4 of the Air Commerce Act of 1926 (44 Stat. 570), it is ordered that paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 10127 of May 23, 1950, describing the boundaries of the airspace reservation above the Hanford Engineer Works, Richland, Washington, be, and it is hereby, amended to read as follows:
"2. Hanford Engineer Works, Richland, Washington:
Beginning at Latitude 46°48'00", Longitude 119°13'13", thence to Latitude 46°20'00", Longitude 119°13'13", thence to Latitude 46°18'06", Longitude 119°30'00", thence to Latitude 46°30'00", Longitude 119°55'30", thence to Latitude 48°39'00", Longitude 119°55'30", thence to Latitude 46°48'00", Longitude 119°47'00", thence to point of beginning."
The amendment made by this order excludes from the airspace reservation above the Hanford Engineer Works air space above certain landmarks useful in air navigation, and will enable aircraft pilots to follow such landmarks without flying within the reservation as now constituted.
