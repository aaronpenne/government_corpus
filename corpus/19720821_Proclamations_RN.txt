By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In the year 1000, Norse explorer Leif Erikson braved the then uncharted waters of the North Atlantic to reach the New World's shores. He and his small band exhibited through their explorations a spirit of adventure and courage which overcame the fears binding so many of their fellow Europeans to the Old World.
Now, more than nine hundred years later, we must summon those same qualities to aid us in meeting the challenges of this world and exploring the unknown of outer space. It is most appropriate that we give national recognition to Leif Erikson, and I am happy to comply with the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 9, 1972, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places across our land.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
