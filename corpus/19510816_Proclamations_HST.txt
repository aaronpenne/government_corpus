Whereas
 on the twentieth day of July 1948, I issued a proclamation calling upon all male persons subject to registration in the several States of the United States, the District of Columbia, the Territories of Alaska and Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands to present themselves for and submit to registration; and
Whereas
 no provision heretofore has been made for the registration of male citizens of the United States who are in the Canal Zone:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by title I of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, do proclaim the following:
1. The registration of male citizens of the United States who shall have attained the eighteenth anniversary of the day of their birth and who shall have not attained the twenty-sixth anniversary of the day of their birth shall take place in the Canal Zone between the hours of 8:00 A.M. and 5:00 P.M. on the day or days hereinafter designated for their registration, as follows:
(a) Persons born on or after September 7, 1925, but not after September 6, 1933, shall be registered on Thursday, the 6th day of September, 1951.
(b) Persons who were born after September 6, 1933, shall be registered on the day they attain the eighteenth anniversary of the day of their birth, or within five days thereafter.
2. (a) Every male citizen of the United States other than persons excepted by section 6(a) of title I of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, and those previously registered pursuant to the said proclamation of July 20, 1948, who is within the Canal Zone and who shall have attained the eighteenth anniversary of the day of his birth and who shall have not attained the twenty-sixth anniversary of the day of his birth on the day or any of the days fixed herein for his registration is required to and shall on that day or any of those days present himself for and submit to registration before a duly designated registration official or selective service local board having jurisdiction in the area in which he has his permanent home or in which he may happen to be on that day or any of those days.
(b) A person subject to registration may register after the day or days fixed for registration in case he is prevented from registering on that day or any of those days be circumstances beyond his control or because he is not present in the Canal Zone on that day or any of those days. If he is not in the Canal Zone on the day or any of the days fixed for registration but subsequently enters the Canal Zone, he shall within five days after such entrance present himself for and submit to registration before a duly designated registration official or selective service local board. If he is in the Canal Zone on the day or any of the days fixed for registration but because of circumstances beyond his control is unable to present himself for and submit to registration on that day or any of those days he shall do so as soon as possible after the cause for such inability ceases to exist.
3. Every person subject to registration is required to familiarize himself with the rules and regulations governing registration and to comply therewith.
4. The duty of any person to present himself for and submit to registration in accordance with any previous proclamation issued under said Act shall not be affected by this proclamation.
5. I call upon the Governor of the Canal Zone, all officers and agents of the Canal Zone, and all local boards which, and agents thereof who, are appointed under the provision of title I of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, or the regulations prescribed thereunder, to do and perform all acts and services necessary to accomplish effective and complete registration.
6. In order that there may be full cooperation in carrying into effect the purposes of title I of the Universal Military Training and Service Act, as amended, I urge all employers and Government agencies of all kindsFederal and localto give those under their charge sufficient time in which to fulfill the obligations of registration incumbent upon them under the said Act and this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 16th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
