By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
As we approach the bicentennial of the founding of the United States of America and consider the elements of our national life, the contributions of men and women of Hispanic origin stand out among those which have enriched our heritage and made our land the great country it is today.
Americans of Hispanic origin or descent have enriched the culture of both this Nation and the worldâ€”as scientists, as statesmen, as artists, as soldiers, as labor leaders, as bankers, and as humble workers. Throughout our history they have helped to build America. We take special pride in the talented men and women of Hispanic origin who today serve in our government.
To acknowledge these important contributions, the Congress by a joint resolution approved September 17, 1968, requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the week which includes September 15 and 16 as National Hispanic Heritage Week. It is for me a welcome privilege to pay homage to Americans of Spanish origin, for in honoring them we honor our Nation's vigorous diversity.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 10, 1972, and ending September 16, 1972, as National Hispanic Heritage Week. I call upon all the people of the United States, especially the educational community, to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
