A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Christopher Columbus with courage and daring sailed an uncharted sea and found a new world which became the haven of millions who sought freedom from oppression and want; and
Whereas
 we, the spiritual and material heirs of Columbus, have through valiant effort and heroic sacrifice preserved our country from those who would have enslaved us and have given strength to all people who have struggled against tyranny; and
Whereas
 we, with the resolute faith of the discoverer of America, have determined that through international organization the freedoms for which this Nation and other nations have waged victorious war shall flourish in peace and security; and
Whereas
, at this period, the Italian people with fortitude and courage are striving to rid their country of the last vestige of fascism, to establish liberty, and to regain an honorable place in the family of nations, it is peculiarly appropriate that we honor the courage and vision of a great Italian, whose discovery gave a birthplace for democracy; and 
Whereas
 Public Resolution 21, Seventy-third Congress, approved April 30, 1934, provides:
That the President of the United States is authorized and requested to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day and calling upon officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on said date and inviting the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, or other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies expressive of the public sentiment befitting the anniversary of the discovery of America:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 12, 1945, as Columbus Day. I direct, also, tat the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day; and I invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in schools and churches or other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
