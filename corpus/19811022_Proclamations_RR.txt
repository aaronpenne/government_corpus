By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Twenty-five years ago the Hungarian people rose to challenge foreign domination of their country and to assert their right to freedom and democratic self-determination. 
Today, many of those same people are citizens of the United States. Their experiences, and their continuing devotion to the ideals for which they fought, have brought new strength and meaning to this Nation's commitment to freedom and justice for all people. 
The Congress of the United States by joint resolution has authorized and requested the President to honor the memory of the brave Hungarian men and women who fought so courageously to achieve the realization of their aspirations in the face of overwhelming military force. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate October 23, 1981, as Hungarian Freedom Fighters' Day. I call upon the people of the United States to reaffirm our belief and hope that all nations will one day achieve through peaceful means the goals of democratic freedom and self-determination for which these gallant people sacrificed so much. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
