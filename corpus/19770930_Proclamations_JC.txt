By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
At the base of any democracy must lie a commitment to education for all. 
Americans, accordingly, have an enormous stake in the vitality of our schools. 
Parents, instead of being strangers to the classrooms in which their children spend so much of their lives, must become partners with teachers. 
But parents and teachers cannot do the job alone. In our attitudes and our actions, in a hundred different ways, each of us influences young people toward education or away from it. This is the significance of this year's theme for American Education Week: "Working Together for Education". 
By sharing our expertise and interests with the schools, we can all enrich educational programs and help determine the course along which our young people will lead America in the years to come. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning November 13, 1977, as American Education Week. 
I ask every American to consider how he or she can work with our Nation's educational community to help America prepare its youngsters to meet the responsibilities they will some day assume. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
