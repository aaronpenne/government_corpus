Leave of absence with pay shall not be charged for any absence which does not occur during the forty hours prescribed as the basic workweek. If in an administrative workweek, the officer or employee does not actually work during any overtime period in excess of the forty hours prescribed as the basic workweek, no overtime compensation shall be paid.

NOTE.-In the foregoing schedule the overtime rate for 416 overtime hours for any basic rate of compensation in excess of $2,980 per annum is computed by subtracting from $894, 7.6782 per centum of the amount by which such basic rate is in excess of $2,980 per annum; with the condition that the rate for 416 overtime hours for all salaries of $6,440 or more shall be $628.334.
(c) Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (b) of this section, the overtime compensation payable to any officer or employee to whom these regulations apply shall, with respect to any pay period, be limited to such rate as will not cause his aggregate compensation for such pay period to exceed a rate of $10,000 per annum: Provided, however, That any such officer or employee who was receiving overtime compensation on June 30, 1945, and whose aggregate rate of compensation on such date was in excess of $10,000 per annum may receive overtime compensation at such rate as will not cause his aggregate rate of compensation for any pay period to exceed the aggregate rate of compensation he was receiving on June 30, 1945, until he ceases to occupy the office or position he occupied on such date or until the overtime hours of work in his administrative workweek are reduced by action of the head of his department or independent establishment or agency, or Government-owned or controlled corporation, and when such overtime hours are reduced, such rate of overtime compensation shall be reduced proportionately.
(d) Employees whose basic rate of compensation is fixed on an annual or monthly basis and adjusted from time to time in accordance with prevailing rates by wage boards or similar administrative authority serving the same purpose shall be entitled to overtime pay in accordance with the provisions of section 23 of the Act of March 28, 1934 (U.S.C., 1940 edition, title 5, sec. 673c). The rate of compensation for each hour of overtime employment of any such employee shall be computed as follows:
(1) If the basic rate of compensation of the employee is fixed on an annual basis, divide such basic rate of compensation by two thousand and eighty (2080) and multiply the quotient by one and one-half; and
(2) If the basic rate of compensation of the employee is fixed on a monthly basis, multiply such basic rate of compensation by twelve to derive a basic annual rate of compensation, divide such basic annual rate of compensation by two thousand eighty (2080), and multiply the quotient by one and one-half.
(e) Whenever, for the purpose of computing overtime pay under these regulations, it is necessary to convert a basic monthly or annual rate to a basic weekly, daily or hourly rate the following rules shall govern:
(1) A monthly rate shall be multiplied by 12 to derive an annual rate;
(2) An annual rate shall be divided by 52 to derive a weekly rate;
(3) A weekly rate shall be divided by 40 to derive an hourly rate; and
(4) A daily rate shall be derived by multiplying an hourly rate by the number of daily hours of service required.
