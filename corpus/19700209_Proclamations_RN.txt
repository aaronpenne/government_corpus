By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Cardiovascular disease imposes a heavy burden on the nation. More than half of all deaths in the United States result from heart disease. It is also a major cause of disability, taking a tremendous toll in both suffering and economic loss. The number of Americans who have some form of heart and blood vessel disease is estimated at more than 27 million. In 1968 the economic cost of such disease was estimated at more than 31 billion dollars.
Despite the vastness of the problem, notable progress is being made in the struggle against this diseaseâ€”largely through research and its application. This progress is attributable to the combined efforts of public and private interests. For continued gains, we look further to the National Heart and Lung Institute, as the chief Federal partner, and the American Heart Association, as the principal voluntary ally. Given the support of all our citizens to reinforce and sustain this effort, we can have cause for optimism in this effort.
For such reasons the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 843), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating February as American Heart Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of February 1970 as American Heart Month, and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
I urge the people of the United States to give heed to the nationwide problem of heart disease, and to support the programs essential to bring about its solution.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
