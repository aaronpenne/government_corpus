A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 reciprocal world trade advances our progress toward global prosperity and abundance, freedom, and well-being; and 
Whereas
 the Kennedy Round of multilateral trade negotiations, which was opened in Geneva, Switzerland, on May 4, is designed to reduce international trade barriers in order to expand market opportunities for the benefit of both developed and developing countries of the world; and 
Whereas
 the expansion of United States export trade is vital to the improvement of our balance of international payments, to the continuing growth of American industry, and to the fuller employment of American workers; and 
Whereas
 the quickening pace of economic progress in nations around the world is enlarging the opportunities for our businessmen to sell American products abroad; and 
Whereas
 the progressive opening of national markets everywhere to greater international competition challenges American businessmen to participate more vigorously in the exchange of goods and services among nations and, thus, to provide an inspiring demonstration of the vigor and value of competitive private enterprise: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 17, 1964, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate Federal, State, and local officials to cooperate in the observance of that week. 
I also urge business, labor, agriculture, educational and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and our relations with other nations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State.
