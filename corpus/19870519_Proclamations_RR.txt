By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As a mark of respect for the American servicemen who died as the result of the attack on United States Ship STARK, which was struck by a missile on May 17, 1987, while on patrol in the Persian Gulf to keep vital sea-lanes open, I hereby order, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States of America by section 175 of title 36 of the United States Code, that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and Possessions through Monday, Memorial Day, May 25, 1987. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
