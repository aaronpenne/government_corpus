By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On October 11, 1974, we will honor the 195th anniversary of the death of Casimir Pulaski, the selfless patriot who fought courageously for the cause of freedom both in Poland and in America. It was on October 11, 1779, that Pulaski gave his life for our young Republic, fatally wounded while leading a cavalry charge in the battle of Savannah. 
Today, we pay grateful tribute to the heroic sacrifice of Casimir Pulaski. And as we do so, we also pay tribute to all Americans of Polish ancestry whose talents, energies, and devotion to freedom have contributed greatly to the growth of this Nation since the earliest days. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 11, 1974, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
