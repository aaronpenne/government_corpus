SECTION 1. Section 2.1 of Civil Service Rule H, as prescribed by Executive Order No. 10577 of November 22, 1954, is hereby amended by adding thereto a new subsection (c) reading as follows:
"(c) Whenever the Civil Service Commission (1) is unable to certify a sufficient number of names to permit the appointing officer to consider three eligibles for appointment to a fourth-class postmaster position in accordance with the regular procedure, or (2) finds that a particular rate of compensation for fourth-class postmaster positions is too low to warrant regular competitive examinations for such positions, it may authorize appointment to any such position or positions in accordance with such procedure as may be prescribed by the Commission. Persons appointed under this subsection may acquire competitive status subject to satisfactory completion of a probationary period prescribed by the Commission"
