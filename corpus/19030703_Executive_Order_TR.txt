On September 25, 1901, Charles B. Terry, a clerk on the temporary roll of the Post-Office Department, was transferred to the position of laborer in the Washington city post-office, apparently in order to provide a place on the temporary roll for a favorite of one of his superior officers. His name was, therefore, not included in the list of employees on the temporary roll which were classified by the act of April 28, 1902. When the facts were brought to the attention of the Postmaster-General he sought, on July 1, 1902, to reinstate Terry to the position he had formerly occupied. Such action, however, required a special exception to the rules. The Commission made an investigation of the circumstances attending his transfer from the temporary roll and became convinced that an injustice had been done him. The investigation, however, disclosed the fact that he had been convicted of a crime in 1894, but had been pardoned and restored to his civil rights by the President. The Commission therefore refused to recommend a special exception to the rules unless he would prove that he was eligible under the rules to take an examination for the same position. Upon his filing an application with satisfactory vouchers in regard to his efficiency and integrity, together with an explanation of his case by the United States attorney stating that Mr. Terry's conviction did not in any way reflect on his honesty or integrity, the Commission submitted a form of Executive order to the President, which received his approval on July 3, 1903.
