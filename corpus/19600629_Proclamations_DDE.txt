A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 1960 marks the two-hundredth anniversary of the recognition of wool production and wool manufacture in the United States as an industry; and
Whereas
 from its humble beginning in the homes and on the farms of the colonists in the early sixteen hundreds, the American wool-growing and textile industry has become an integral part of our national economy, representing more than five billion dollars a year in the retail value of its products; and
Whereas
 its nationwide scope is evidenced by the fact that in more than three thousand of the three thousand and sixty-eight counties in the United States there are one or more wool-production or textile operations, with wool grown in every one of the fifty States of the Union; and
Whereas
 the Congress, in recognition of the importance of the wool industry and the part it plays in our national economy, has by a joint resolution approved June 29, 1960, requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the month of September 1960 as National Wool Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of September 1960 as National Wool Month; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that month with appropriate activities and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-ninth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
