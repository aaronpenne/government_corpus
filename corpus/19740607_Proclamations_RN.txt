By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
For many Americans, Father's Day is best celebrated by showering the male head of the household with carefully chosen gifts.
These gifts are symbolic, of course, of the year-round love and gratitude which children feel for both of their parents. From their fathers frequently come the strength and stability which children of all ages need in order to grow up to be constructive, confident men and women. Fathers offer guiding hands for children to pass successfully through the difficulties and awkwardness of youth. And fathers bring harmony and balance to life in the home.
Nineteen seventy-four is an especially poignant time to celebrate Father's Day, since this year no young American soldiers are being sent to fight anywhere in the world. A nation at peace: this is the legacy that all fathers want to leave their children and is ultimately the greatest gift of all on Father's Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of Congress approved April 24, 1972, do hereby request that June 16, 1974 be observed as Father's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
