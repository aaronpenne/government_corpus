By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
No resource is more vital to the welfare of the United States than clean water. Virtually every aspect of modern life depends in some way on an abundant and clear supply of this precious gift of nature. 
Americans use well over 100 billion gallons of water every day; the water that sustains and nourishes us must be safe, and agriculture and industry alike require clean water. Because clean water is the basis of life for myriad species of animals, clean rivers, streams, lakes, estuaries, and oceans are essential. 
Given the universal importance of clean water, it is fitting that we set aside a day to recommit our energies to wisely managing this precious resource for ourselves and for generations yet unborn. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 160, has designated July 25, 1987, as "Clean Water Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in its observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 25, 1987, as Clean Water Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fourth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
