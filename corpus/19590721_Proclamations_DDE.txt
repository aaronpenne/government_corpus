A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 experience has shown that effective community fire-prevention programs can save thousands of lives each year and millions of dollars in property values; and
Whereas
 increased fire losses during the past year emphasize the need for increased care, responsibility, and community action on the part of all of the American people:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 4, 1959, as Fire Prevention Week.
I call upon our people to promote programs for the prevention of fires; and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public-information agencies, to share actively in observing Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national effort to reduce the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 21st day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
