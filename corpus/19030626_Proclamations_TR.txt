Whereas,

Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the authority in me vested, and in pursuance of said Act of the Congress, approved July 1, 1902, do hereby declare, proclaim and make known that the following described lands be, and the same are hereby, reserved for naval purposes, to wit:
All public lands, natural, reclaimed, partly reclaimed, or which may be reclaimed, in the island of Porto Rico, embraced within the following boundaries:

The entire island lying to the southward of the above described reservations, and shown on the United States Hydrographic Map No. 1745 of July, 1898, as Isla Grande (or Manglar), said island being more particularly described as situated in the north-eastern part of the harbor of San Juan, Porto Rico, and bounded on the north by the Cano de San Antonio and the strait connecting the Cano de San Antonio with Miraflores Bay, on the east by the strait connecting the Cano de San Antonio with Miraflores Bay and by Miraflores Bay; on the south by Miraflores Bay and by the waters of that part of the harbor of San Juan which separates Isla Grande from Anegado and Largo shoals, and on the west by that part of the waters of the harbor of San Juan which separates Isla Grande from the city of San Juan and the Puntilla.
3. All public lands and the structures thereon, situated on the peninsula extending into the harbor on the south side of the city of San Juan, Porto Rico, known as the Barrio de la Puntilla, or Puntilla Point, bounded on the north by the south boundary of the Paseo de la Princesa, and on the east, south and west, by the navigable waters of the harbor of San Juan, at such port warden's line as may be established by competent authority.

In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
