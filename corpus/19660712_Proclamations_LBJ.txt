A Proclamation
Destructive fires—many of which could be avoided by eliminating known fire hazards—result in the tragic waste of life, property, and irreplaceable natural resources. 
Inevitably such fires bring sorrow and financial difficulties to many families. 
The toll of life and property occasioned by fire has been sharply reduced in those communities where fire prevention programs have been conducted. 
Further progress is essential. Further progress can be made if every individual assumes the responsibility for removing the hazards and reforming the habits which cause fires. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 9, 1966, as Fire Prevention Week. 
I urge State and local governments, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the American Red Cross, the National Fire Protection Association, and business, labor, farm and youth organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies to observe Fire Prevention Week, to provide useful fire safety information to the public, and to enlist the active participation of all citizens in year-round fire prevention programs. 
I bid all citizens to support earnestly the fire prevention and control efforts of their community fire departments. 
I also direct the appropriate Federal agencies to assist in this effort to reduce the needless waste of life and property caused by preventable fires. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
