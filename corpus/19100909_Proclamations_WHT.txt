By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the Act of the Congress directing the disposal of lands within a specified part of the Crow Indian Reservation, in the State of Montana, approved April 27, 1904 (33 United States Statutes at Large, 352) provides among other things: 
That when, in the judgment of the President, no more of the land herein ceded can be disposed of at said price, he may by proclamation, to be repeated at his discretion, sell from time to time the remaining land subject to the provisions of the homestead law or otherwise as he may deem most advantageous, at such price or prices, in such manner, upon such conditions, with such restrictions, and upon such terms as he may deem best for all the interests concerned;
And, Whereas,
 in my judgment, no more of said lands can be disposed of at the price named in said Act, except such of them as have been withdrawn under the Reclamation Act; and it being believed that said undisposed of lands can be most advantageously disposed of in the manner hereinafter prescribed; 
Now, Therefore, I, William H. Taft,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim and direct that all of the unentered nonmineral, unreserved lands affected by said act which have not been withdrawn under the Reclamation Act, and which are not embraced in any valid existing right initiated under the public land laws be offered for sale at public auction under the supervision of James W. Witten, Superintendent of the Opening and Sale of Indian Lands, at the city of Billings, in the State of Montana, on October 15, 1910, and thereafter, in legal subdivisions approximating three hundred and twenty acres each, as near as may be, except in cases where the owners or purchasers of lands adjacent to offered tracts shall request the offering of such adjacent tracts in smaller legal subdivisions. 
No person will be permitted to purchase more than four quarter sections, or at a less price than two dollars per acre, and the purchaser of each tract must pay one-fifth of the purchase price thereof before 4.30 o'clock on the sale day following the date on which such purchase is made, or if the purchase is made on the last day of the sale said payment must be made before 4.30 o'clock on that date. The remainder of the purchase money may be paid in four equal annual installments in one, two, three, and four years after the date of the sale. If any purchaser shall at any time fail to make any payment when it becomes due all rights under his purchase, and all moneys theretofore paid thereunder will be forfeited. All lands offered but not sold at the sale herein directed shall thereafter be subject to purchase at private sale in the areas under the terms, conditions and limitations mentioned in this proclamation at two dollars per acre. 
The Secretary of the Interior, and the Superintendent of the sale as emergencies arise, may make and prescribe such rules and regulations not in conflict herewith as the proper conducting of the sale may require, and the superintendent of the sale may reject any and all bids, and may indefinitely postpone the sale or adjourn it from time to time as occasion may demand. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and ten, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-fifth.
