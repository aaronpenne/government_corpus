By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
July 6, 1986, marks the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of an airways traffic control system by the United States Bureau of Air Commerce. In that fifty-year period, the Nation's air traffic control system has evolved from reliance on relatively simple, unsophisticated equipment and procedures to today's highly sophisticated automated system, which safely and efficiently handles millions of flights each year and serves as a model for the world aviation community. 
With the commitment and skill of thousands of Federal Aviation Administration employees, including air traffic controllers, electronic technicians, and engineers, the national air traffic control system offers a high level of safety and efficiency that has been its proud hallmark. Thus, as we celebrate National Air Traffic Control Day, let us remember with gratitude those who have dedicated themselves to making the system what it is today, and let us thank those who are working to make it even better for tomorrow. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 188, has designated July 6, 1986, as "National Air Traffic Control Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 6, 1986, as National Air Traffic Control Day. I call upon the people of this Nation and their Federal, State, and local governmental officials to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the United States air traffic control system. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 3rd day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
