A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 two prehistoric ruins of ancient cliff dwellings situated upon public lands of the United States, and located in the region commonly known as the Tonto Drainage Basin, about two miles south of the Salt River Reservoir, Gila County, Arizona, are of great ethnologic, scientific and educational interest, and it appears that the public interests would be promoted by reserving these relics of a vanished people as a National Monument with as much land as may be necessary for the proper protection thereof; 
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by section two of the Act of Congress approved June 8, 1906, entitled "An Act for the Preservation of American Antiquities," do hereby set aside as the Tonto National Monument, subject to any valid interest or rights, the prehistoric cliff dwelling ruins and one section of land upon which same are located, situated in Gila County, Arizona, more particularly described as follows, to wit: 
Section thirty-four, unsurveyed, in township four north, range twelve east of the Gila and Salt River Meridian, Arizona, as shown upon the diagram hereto attached and made a part of this Proclamation.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, excavate, injure or destroy any of the prehistoric ruins or remains thereof declared to be a National Monument, or to locate or settle upon any of the lands reserved and made a part of said monument by this Proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of December in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-second.
