A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 there is in northwestern Arizona on the road between Zion National Park and the North Rim of the Grand Canyon National Park a spring, known as Pipe Spring, which affords the only water along the road between Hurricane, Utah, and Fredonia, Arizona, a distance of sixty-two miles; and
Whereas,
 a settlement was made at Pipe Spring in 1863 and there was built a large dwelling place, called "Windsor Castle," with portholes in its walls, which was used as a place of refuge from hostile Indians by the early settlers, and it was also the first station of the Deseret Telegraph in Arizona; and
Whereas,
 it appears that the public good would be promoted by reserving the land on which Pipe Spring and the early dwelling place, are located as a National Monument, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper protection thereof, to serve as a memorial of western pioneer life,
Now, Therefore, I, Warren G. Harding,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by section two of the act of Congress entitled, "An Act for die Preservation of American Antiquities" approved June 8, 1906 (34 Stat., 225) do proclaim that there is hereby reserved, subject to all prior valid claims, and set apart as a National Monument to be known as the Pipe Spring National Monument the lands shown upon the diagram hereto annexed and made a part hereof and more particularly described as follows:
The southeast quarter of the southeast quarter of section seventeen, township forty north, range four west, Gila and Salt River Base and Meridian.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy, or remove any of the features or objects included within the boundaries of this Monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
The Director of the Natidnal Park Service, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have the supervision, management and control of this Monument, as provided in the act of Congress entitled, "An Act to establish a National Park Service, and for other purposes," approved August 25, 1916 (39 Stat., 535), as amended June 2, 1920 (41 Stat., 732): Provided, that in the administration of this Monument, the Indians of the Kaibab Reservation shall have the privilege of utilizing waters from Pipe Spring for irrigation, stock watering and other purposes, under regulations to be prescribed by the Secretary of the Interior.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this thirty-first day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-seventh.
