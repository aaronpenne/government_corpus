Such expenses shall be paid from the Veterans' Administration account described in Section 3 of this Order. 
Sec. 3. During fiscal year 1983 and each succeeding fiscal year, the Secretary of Defense shall transfer, from time to time, from the "Retired Pay, Defense" account of the Department of Defense to an account established in the Veterans' Administration, such amounts as the Administrator of Veterans' Affairs determines to be necessary to pay the benefits authorized by Section 156 during fiscal year 1983 and each succeeding fiscal year, and the expenses incurred by the Veterans' Administration in paying such benefits during fiscal year 1983 and each succeeding fiscal year. Such transfers shall, to the extent feasible, be made in advance of the payment of benefits and expenses by the Veterans' Administration.
