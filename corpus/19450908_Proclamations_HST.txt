By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 4067 of the Revised Statutes of the United States (50 U.S.C. 21) makes provision relative to the restraint and removal from the United States of alien enemies in the interest of the public safety;
Whereas
 the Congress by joint resolutions approved by the President on December 8 and 11, 1941, and June 5, 1942, declared the existence of a state of war between the United States on the one hand and Japan, Germany, Italy, Bulgaria, Hungary, and Rumania on the other hand;
Whereas
 in accordance with Resolution XVII of the Conference of Foreign Ministers at Rio de Janeiro adopted on January 28, 1942, and subsequently by undertakings based upon Resolution XX of the Emergency Advisory Committee for Political Defense adopted at Montevideo on May 21, 1943, there has been assumed by the Government of the United States responsibility for the restraint and repatriation of certain dangerous alien enemies sent to the United States from other of the American republics in the interest of the security of the Western Hemisphere;
Whereas
 by Resolution VII of the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace adopted at Mexico City on March 8, 1945, the American republics recommended the adoption of measures to prevent any person whose deportation was deemed necessary for reasons of security of the continent from further residing in this hemisphere, if such residence would be prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the Americas;
Whereas
 I find it necessary in the light of the commitments of the Government and in the interest of national defense and public safety to prescribe regulations additional and supplemental to all other regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies in order to cover the case of the persons above referred to:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution of the United States and the aforesaid section of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do hereby prescribe and proclaim the following regulations, additional and supplemental to all other regulations affecting the restraint and removal of alien enemies:
All alien enemies now within the continental limits of the United States (1) who were sent here from other American republics for restraint and repatriation pursuant to international commitments of the United States Government and for the security of the United States and its associated powers and (2) who are within the territory of the United States without admission under the immigration laws are, if their continued residence in the Western Hemisphere is deemed by the Secretary of States prejudicial to the future security or welfare of the Americas as prescribed in Resolution VII of the Inter-American Conference on Problems of War and Peace, subject upon the order of the Secretary of State to removal to destinations outside the limits of the Western Hemisphere in territory of the enemy governments to which or to the principles of which they have adhered. The Department of Justice and all other appropriate agencies of the United States Government are directed to render assistance to the Secretary of State in the prompt effectuation of such orders of removal.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
