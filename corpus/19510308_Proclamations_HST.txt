A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States of America, built by millions of devoted, faithful, and vigilant men and women of many races and creeds, carries high the Torch of Liberty, not only to guide our own people, but also to light the way for other freedom-loving peoples; and
Whereas
 in this tense period of world history our Nation must strengthen its unity of purpose through increased devotion to the fundamental principles of individual liberty, equal opportunity, and justice for all; and 
Whereas
 it is especially fitting at this time that each and every citizen of the United States, whether native or naturalized, should renew his faith in the ideals that form the foundation upon which our country has been built into a mighty force for the advancement of freedom's cause:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the united States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Congress through Public Resolution 767, approved May 3, 1940 (54 Stat. 178), do hereby designate Sunday, May 20, 1951, as "I Am An American Day", and do set aside that day as a public occasion for the recognition, observance, and commemoration of United States citizenship, and for the special recognition of those of our youth who have attained their majority and of those foreign-born who have become citizens through naturalization during the past year.
I also urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as patriotic, civic, educational, and other interested organizations, to arrange for appropriate ceremonies on or about May 20 in which all our people may join, to the end that both old and new citizens may have a fuller understanding of their rights and privileges and of their obligations and responsibilities as citizens.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this eighth day of March in the Year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
