The Governors of the member States of the New England River Basins Commission and the Water Resources Council have requested that the jurisdiction of the Commission be extended to include those portions of the States of Vermont and Massachusetts which are not presently included within the area of the Commission's jurisdiction. I have determined that it would be in the public interest to comply with that request.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 201 of the Water Resources Planning Act (42 U.S.C. 1962b) and as President of the United States, subsections (3) and (4) of section 2 of Executive Order No. 11371 of September 6, 1967, as amended, are hereby amended to read as follows:
"(3) The State of Vermont,
"(4) The State of Massachusetts,".
