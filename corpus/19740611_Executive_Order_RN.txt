By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, including sections 3301 and 7301 of title 5 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
SECTION 1. Except when otherwise provided by statute, the appeals system established by the Civil Service Commission under chapter 77 of title 5 of the United States Code, and section 22 of Executive Order No. 11491 of October 29, 1969, shall constitute the sole system of appeal for an employee who is covered by that appeals system.
SEC. 2. Executive Order No. 10987, relating to agency systems for appeals from adverse action, is revoked.
SEC. 3. This order shall be effective on the 90th day after issuance and shall apply to all adverse actions effective on and after that day. However, an appeal timely filed from an adverse action effective prior to that day under an agency appeals system established pursuant to Executive Order No. 10987 shall be processed to completion under that system.
