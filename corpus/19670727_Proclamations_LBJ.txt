By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
From its earliest day, our nation has been dedicated to justice, to equalityâ€”and to order.
We are a people committed to the rule of law, believing that it holds the greatest hope for human progress and well-being. We must never abandon that commitment.
Today our people reaffirm their faith in law; their faith in progress; their faith in human brotherhood.
It is right to pray that strife will not bring down what we have built, nor threaten all the things we hope to build.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Sunday, July 30, 1967, as a National Day of Prayer for Peace and Reconciliation.
I call on every Governor, every Mayor, every family in the land to join in this observance. I call on all our citizens to go into their churches on this Sunday, and to pray for peace in the land we love.
We deplore the few who rely upon words and works of terror.
We mourn the many who have suffered from violence in the cities. We dedicate ourselves once more to the rule of law, in whose absence anarchy is loosed and tragedy is born.
We pray to Almighty God, the Author of our liberty, for hearts free from hate, so that our Nation can be free from bitterness.
We pray for strength to build together so that disorder may cease, progress steadily continue, and justice prosper.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
