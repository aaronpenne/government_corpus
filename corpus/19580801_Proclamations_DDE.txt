A Proclamation
 
Our fathers trusted in God, and they were not confounded. Believing that all men are "endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights," they conquered the wilderness, built homes, charted the course of free institutions, and defended their liberties against forces which threatened from within and from without.
In our time, buffeted by unprecedented changes and challenged by an aggressive denial of Divine Providence, we have continuing need of the wisdom and strength that come from God, and we shall always find our highest satisfaction in a steadfast purpose to know and to do His will.
In this spirit, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved April 17, 1952 (66 Stat. 64), has provided "That the President shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation at churches, in groups, and as individuals."
It is a privilege to carry out this resolution, and I accordingly set aside Wednesday, the first day of October 1958, as a National Day of Prayer; and I call upon my fellow Americans and all who may be visitors in our country, each according to his own faith, to join in prayer for our Nation and for all mankind, and especially:
First, that we may be humbly mindful that this Nation, under God, arrived at its present position by the toil and sacrifice of many citizens who subordinated personal interests to the common welfare and passed on to us a heritage with which we are singularly blessed;
Second, that we may have Divine guidance in our efforts to lead our children in the paths of truth and to provide a healthy environment in which they may grow in body, mind, and spirit;
Third, that we may ever exercise a compassionate concern for human suffering, whether at home or in distant lands, and that we may strive to alleviate hunger, eradicate disease, and advance the well-being of our neighbors;
Fourth, that we may be saved from blinding pride and from any act hurtful to the concord of free nations joined in building a just and durable peace under the guiding hand of Almighty God;
And, finally, that we may have courage to move forward in the unconquerable spirit of a free people, strong in faith, having a will to endure the burdens which have been given us to carry in our day, and to work toward goals of human betterment which may be attained only beyond our span of years.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
