By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), the Secretary of Agriculture advised me that there was reason to believe that rye, rye flour, and rye meal are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price-support program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to rye pursuant to sections 301 and 401 of the Agricultural Act of 1949, as amended, or to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which such program of the Department of Agriculture is being undertaken; and
Whereas
, on June 23, 1959, I caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation under section 22 with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Tariff Commission has made such investigation and has reported to me its findings and recommendations made in connection therewith; and
Whereas
, on the basis of the investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that rye, rye flour, and rye meal, in the aggregate, are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to interfere materially with, and to tend to render ineffective, the price-support program with respect to rye, and to reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic rye with respect to which the price-support program is being undertaken; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed is shown by such investigation of the Tariff Commission to be necessary in order that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption, of rye, rye flour, and rye meal will not render ineffective, or materially interfere with, such price-support program; and
Whereas
 I find that the quantitative limitations hereinafter proclaimed will not reduce the permissible total quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered to proportionately less than 50 per centum of the average annual quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered during the representative period July 1, 1950, to June 30, 1953, inclusive; and
Whereas
 the allocation of the quotas among foreign supplying countries as hereinafter prescribed will assure an equitable distribution of the imports of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered hereunder, based upon the proportion of imports for consumption that such foreign countries supplied during the representative period:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim 
1. That for the period commencing August 5, 1959, and ending August 31, 1959, the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered shall not exceed 6,741,268 pounds, of which not more than 518 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal;
2. That for the ten-month period commencing September 1, 1959, and ending June 30, 1960, the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered shall not exceed 77,399,736 pounds, of which not more than 5,939 pounds may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal;
3. That for the twelve-month period commencing July 1, 1960, and ending June 30, 1961, the total aggregate quantity of rye, rye flour, and rye meal entered shall not exceed an amount determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as soon as practicable after June 30, 1960, to be the equivalent of 186,000,000 pounds less the amount, if any, by which entries during the period July 1, 1959, to June 30, 1960, exceeded 186,000,000 pounds: Provided, That the amount so determined shall not be less than 92,879,683 pounds, and that of the amount so determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, not more than 0.00806 per centum may be in the form of rye flour or rye meal;
4. That of the 6,741,268 pounds specified in paragraph 1, not more than 6,606,443 shall be the product of Canada and not more than 134,825 shall be the product of other foreign countries; that of the 77,399,736 pounds specified in paragraph 2, not more than 75,851,741 shall be the product of Canada and not more than 1,547,995 shall be the product of other foreign countries; that of the amount to be determined under paragraph 3, not more than 98 per centum shall be the product of Canada and not more than 2 per centum shall be the product of other foreign countries.
The provisions of this proclamation shall not apply to certified or registered seed rye for use for seeding and crop-improvement purposes, in bags tagged and sealed by an officially recognized seed-certifying agency of the country of production, ifâ€”
(a) the individual shipment amounts to 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) or less, or
(b) the individual shipment amounts to more than 100 bushels (of 56 pounds each) and the written approval of the Secretary of Agriculture or his designated representative is presented at the time of entry, or bond is furnished in a form prescribed by the Commissioner of Customs in an amount equal to the value of the merchandise as set forth in the entry, plus the estimated duty as determined at the time of entry, conditioned upon the production of such written approval within six months from the date of entry.
As used in this proclamation, the term "entered" means "entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption."
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fourth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
