(c) (1) Whenever, in accordance with subsection (b) of this section, it is determined that the recreation user fee for an area should be reduced or eliminated, such action shall be taken forthwith.

Sec. 5.

Each such official shall also specify which designated areas shall be excluded from the coverage of the annual fee described in Section 2(a)(1) of the Act and which, as a result of that exclusion will be subject to the fee described in Section 2(a) (iii) of the Act. The range of recreation user fees to be charged and the criteria for their selection shall be established under the procedures prescribed by Section 6 of this Order.

With the approval of all other officials described in Section 1 (b) of this Order, the provisions of this subsection may be waived with respect to any specific measure or regulation adopted, by the Secretary of the Interior pursuant to this order so that any such measure or regulation may be made effective before the expiration of the 30-day waiting period prescribed by the first sentence of this subsection.

The officials described in Section 1(b) of this Order shall, within a reasonable time, review all existing contracts and other arrangements between their respective agencies and any non-Federal public entity which relate to non-Federal management of Federally-owned outdoor recreation areas. Special attention shall be given to any provision in any such contract or other arrangement which prohibits or discourages in any way such non-Federal public entity from charging recreation user fees. Unless otherwise prohibited by law, each such restrictive provision shall be the subject of renegotiation designed to accomplish a modification thereof that will permit the charging of recreation user fees.
