A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross serves as a voluntary auxiliary to the Government of the United States in matters vitally affecting the welfare of the American people, both in time of peace and in national emergencies; and 
Whereas
 such Red Cross services as the Blood Program, Disaster Services, First Aid and Nursing Services, and the many other programs of its trained volunteers must be maintained at maximum effectiveness at all times; and 
Whereas
, by virtue of the responsibility vested in the American Red Cross by its congressional charter, it also acts as a medium of communication between the people of the United States and their Armed Forces and in matters of voluntary relief affecting our servicemen and women and their families; and 
Whereas
 these essential services to the Government of the United States and the American people are made possible by the 45,000,000 members and volunteers of 3,600 Red Cross chapters throughout the Nation; and 
Whereas
 the United States of America is a member of the International Red Cross family through adherence to the Red Cross Treaty of Geneva which this Government signed in 1882; and 
Whereas
 this great international movement, founded at Geneva in 1863, observes its centenary this year; and 
Whereas
 the American Red Cross, as a member of the League of Red Cross Societies and in cooperation with the League, has assisted in many of the great international relief programs of our times, bringing the means of existence and hope to millions of victims of war, civil strife, disaster, and epidemic; and, acting under the provisions of the Geneva Conventions, has furnished volunteer aid to the sick and wounded of armies in time of war and has protected prisoners of war: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March 1963 as Red Cross Month; and I urge all Americans to honor the American Red Cross by participating in, and strengthening, its work. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this First day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
