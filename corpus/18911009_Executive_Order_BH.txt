General Rule III, clause 6, is hereby amended by striking out the words "under such regulations as the Commission may make" and substituting therefor the following: "under regulations to be approved by the President;" so that as amended the clause will read as follows:
So far as practicable and useful competitive examinations shall be established in the classified civil service to test fitness for promotion under regulations to be approved by the President.

Whereas civil-service rules for the Indian service were approved to take effect October 1, 1891; and
Whereas it is represented to me by the Civil Service Commission in a communication of this date that no persons have as yet been examined for appointment to that service, and that it seems probable that complete arrangements for putting said rules into full effect will not be made sooner than March 1, 1892:
 It is therefore ordered,
 That said Indian rules shall take effect March 1, 1892, instead of October 1, 1891:
 Provided,
 That said rules shall become operative and take effect in any district of the Indian service as soon as an eligible register for such district shall be provided, if it shall be prior to the date above fixed.
EXECUTIVE MANSION,
 October 13, 1891.
 
Upon the recommendation of the Commission the foregoing order is approved.
