A Proclamation
 
As a nation and as individuals we have passed another twelve months in the favor of the Almighty. He has smiled upon our fields and they have brought forth plentifully; business has prospered; industries have flourished, and labor has been well employed. While sections of our country have been visited by disaster, we have been spared any great national calamity or pestilential visitation. We are blessed among the nations of the earth.
Our moral and spiritual life has kept measure with our material prosperity. We are not unmindful of the gratitude we owe to God for His watchful care which has pointed out to us the ways of peace and happiness; we should not fail in our acknowledgment of His divine favor which has bestowed upon us so many blessings. Neither should we be forgetful of those among us who, through stress of circumstances, are less fortunately placed, but by deeds of charity make our acknowledgment more acceptable in His sight.
Wherefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States, do hereby set apart Thursday, the twenty-fifth day of November next as a day of general thanksgiving and prayer, and I recommend that on that day the people shall cease from their daily work, and in their homes or in their accustomed places of worship, devoutly give thanks to the Almighty for the many and great blessings they have received, and seek His guidance that through good deeds and brotherly love they may deserve a continuance of His favor.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington, this thirtieth day of October, in the year of Our Lord One Thousand Nine Hundred and Twenty-six, and of the Independence of the United States, the One Hundred and Fifty-first.
CALVIN COOLIDGE

JOSEPH C. GREW,
