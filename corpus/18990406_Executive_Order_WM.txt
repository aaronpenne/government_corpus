In accordance with the provision of the Act of Congress approved June 4, 1897 (30 stat., 36), and by virtue of the authority thereby given and on the recommendation of the Secretary of the Interior, it is hereby ordered that the east half of the northwest quarter and the west half of the northeast corner of section twenty (20), township ten (10) south, range five (5) east, Willamette Meridian, Oregon, with the limits of the Cascade Range Forest Reservation, be restored to the Public Domain after sixty days' notice hereof by publication, as required by law, these tracts having been found better adapted to agricultural than forest purposes.
