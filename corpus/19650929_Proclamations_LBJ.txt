A Proclamation
 
In our schools and colleges rest our hopes for the future: our highest aspirations for our children, for our country and for the world.
For education brings benefits without limits. It endows men not only with the ability to make a living, but with the precious capacity to live with purpose.
It is the richest legacy this generation can bequeath to the next; upon it depends fulfillment for our nation and for every American citizen.
We must, therefore, strive ceaselessly to enrich our educational system, to assure that the benefits of that system flow freely and abundantly to all citizens.
We must assess the educational needs of the Nationâ€” and we must labor constantly to fulfill those needs.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 7 through November 13, 1965, as American Education Week.
I call upon all Americans to consider deeply the aims and goals of American education. I urge parents to acquaint themselves fully with both the problems and the promise of their schools. And I urge each community to study the needs of its schools and to use all the resources at its command to make equal educational opportunity a reality for all Americans.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-ninth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
