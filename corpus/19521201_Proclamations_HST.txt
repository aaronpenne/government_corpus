A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948, as a common standard of achievement for all nations and all peoples, and the anniversary of its adoption is now celebrated each year by free peoples throughout the world; and
Whereas
 the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, our great American Bill of Rights, became effective on December 15, 1791, so that the anniversary of this significant event in our own history falls close to the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
Whereas
 many of the rights and freedoms set forth in our Bill of Rights and in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, including the immeasurable privileges of freedom of speech, religion, assembly, and petition, are similarly affirmed in the constitutions and basic laws of our States and territories; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that this anniversary should be observed by our schools, our churches, our labor unions, and our religious, educational, and civic organizations of all kinds the freedom of which has been safeguarded through these guarantees of individual liberty:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, having in 1949 designated December 10 of that year and each succeeding year as United Nations Human Rights Day, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to celebrate December 10, 1952, by studying the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution of the United States, and the constitutions of our States and territories, and by giving thanks for the priceless heritage of liberty embodied in these great documents.
We do not forget that in past years men in many lands have died to win these freedoms and preserve them for our generation. It is to defend and safeguard these same freedoms that the United Nations is resisting communist aggression in Korea, and is seeking to promote the liberty and security of all peoples.
In this celebration let us join with the peoples of the other free nations of the world in recognition of our common purpose to defend and further the rights and freedoms of all people as proclaimed in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and in so doing renew our determination that here in our own land the great guarantees in our Bills of Rights shall not be lost or weakened or curtailed.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 1st day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DAVID BRUCE,
