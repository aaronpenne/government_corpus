WHEREAS it is the policy of the United States Government to encourage by affirmative action the elimination of discrimination because of race, creed, color, or national origin in employment on work involving Federal financial assistance, to the end that employment opportunities created by Federal funds shall be equally available to all qualified persons; and 
WHEREAS Executive Order No. 10925 of March 6, 1961, 26 F.R. 1977, reaffirmed the policy of requiring the inclusion of non-discrimination provisions in Government contracts and established the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity to administer the program for obtaining adherence to and compliance with such provisions; and 
WHEREAS construction under programs of Federal grants, loans, and other forms of financial assistance to State and local governments and to private organizations creates substantial employment opportunities; and 
WHEREAS it is deemed desirable and appropriate to extend the existing program for nondiscrimination in employment in Government contracts established by Executive Order No. 10925 to include certain contracts for construction financed with assistance from the Federal Government; and 
WHEREAS it is also desirable to amend Executive Order No. 10925 in certain respects in order to clarify the authority of the President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity:

'During the performance of this contract, the contractor agrees as follows: 
Â‘(1) The contractor will not discriminate against any employee or applicant for employment because of race, creed, color, or national origin. The contractor will take affirmative action to ensure that applicants are employed, and that employees are treated during employment, without regard to their race, creed, color, or national origin. Such action shall include, but not be limited, to the following: employment, upgrading, demotion or transfer; recruitment or recruitment advertising; layoff or termination; rates of pay or other forms of compensation; and selection for training, including apprenticeship.

'(3) The contractor will send to each labor union or representative of workers with which he has a collective bargaining agreement or other contract or understanding, a notice, to be provided by the agency contracting officer, advising the said labor union or workers' representative of the contractor's commitments under this section, and shall post copies of the notice in conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment.
