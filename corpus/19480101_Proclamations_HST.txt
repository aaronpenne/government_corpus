By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 350(a) and (b) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 1 of the act of June 12, 1934 entitled "AN ACT To amend the Tariff Act of 1930", by the Joint Resolution approved June 7, 1943, and by section 2 of the Act of July 5, 1945, provides as follows:
SEC. 350. (a) For the purpose of expanding foreign markets for the products of the United States (as a means of assisting in the present emergency in restoring the American standard of living, in overcoming domestic unemployment and the present economic depression, in increasing the purchasing power of the American public, and in establishing and maintaining a better relationship among various branches of American agriculture, industry, mining, and commerce) by regulating the admission of foreign goods into the United States in accordance with the characteristics and needs of various branches of American production so that foreign markets will be made available to those branches of American production which require and are capable of developing such outlets by affording corresponding market opportunities for foreign products in the United States, the President, whenever he finds as a fact that any existing duties or other import restrictions of the United States or any foreign country are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that the purpose above declared will be promoted by the means hereinafter specified, is authorized from time to time
(1) To enter into foreign trade agreements with foreign governments or instrumentalities thereof; and
(2) To proclaim such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions, or such additional import restrictions, or such continuance, and for such minimum periods, of existing customs or excise treatment of any article covered by foreign trade agreements, as are required or appropriate to carry out any foreign trade agreement that the President has entered into hereunder. No proclamation shall be made increasing or decreasing by more than 50 per centum any rate of duty, however established, existing on January 1, 1945 (even though temporarily suspended by act of Congress), or transferring any article between the dutiable and free lists. The proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall apply to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of all foreign countries, whether imported directly, or indirectly: Provided, That the President may suspend the application to articles the growth, produce, or manufacture of any country because of its discriminatory treatment of American commerce or because of other acts (including the operations of international cartels) or policies which in his opinion tend to defeat the purposes set forth in this section; and the proclaimed duties and other import restrictions shall be in effect from and after such time as is specified in the proclamation. The President may at any time terminate any such proclamation in whole or in part.
(b) Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent the application, with respect to rates of duty established under this section pursuant to agreements with countries other than Cuba, of the provisions of the treaty of commercial reciprocity concluded between the United States and the Republic of Cuba on December 11, 1902, or to preclude giving effect to an exclusive agreement with Cuba concluded under this section, modifying the existing preferential customs treatment of any article the growth, produce, or manufacture of Cuba: Provided, That the duties on such an article shall in no case be increased or decreased by more than 50 per centum of the duties, however established existing on January 1, 1945 (even though temporarily suspended by act of Congress). (48 Stat. 943 and 944, ch. 474, 57 Stat. 125, ch. 118, 59 Stat. 410 and 411, ch. 269; 19 U.S.C. 1940) 1351(a), 19 U.S.C. (1940) Supp. V. 1351(a)(2) and (b).):
Whereas
 the period within which the President is authorized to enter into trade agreements under the said section 350 was extended by section 1 of the Act of July 5, 1945 until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1945 (48 Stat. 944, ch. 474, 59 Stat. 410, ch. 269; 19 U.S.C. (1940) Supp. V, 1352(c).);
Whereas, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, have found as a fact that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba are unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States of America and that the purpose declared in said section 350(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, will be promoted by a trade agreement between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Republic of Cuba;
Whereas
 reasonable public notice of the intention to negotiate such trade agreement was given and the views presented by persons interested in the negotiation thereof were received and considered;
Whereas
, after seeking and obtaining information and advice with respect thereto from the United States Tariff Commission, the Departments of State, Agriculture, Commerce, the Army, and the Navy, and from other sources, on October 30, 1947 I entered, through my duly empowered Plenipotentiary, into an exclusive trade agreement with the Government of the Republic of Cuba, which exclusive trade agreement, as supplemented by an exchange of notes between the Acting Secretary of State and the United States of America and the Ambassador of the Republic of Cuba, signed December 19 and 22, 1947, by two exchanges of letters between the Acting Chairman of the United States Delegation to the Second Session of the Preparatory Committee for the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment and the President of the Cuban Delegation thereto, signed October 30, 1947, by a memorandum of October 28, 1947 from the Cuban Delegation, and by two memoranda of October 30, 1947 from the Cuban Delegation, in the English and Spanish languages, is annexed to this proclamation;
Whereas 
the provisions of numbered paragraph 2 of said exclusive trade agreement providing for the application to products of the Republic of Cuba of portions of schedule XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 30, 1947, and of article 17 of the Draft Charter for an International Trade Organization recommended by the Preparatory Committee of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment make those portions of said schedule, and all other provisions of said general agreement and of the protocol of Provisional Application thereof which relate to the schedule or to the concessions therein, and said article 17 a part of said exclusive trade agreement insofar as they apply to products of the Republic of Cuba;
Whereas
 part II of, and the general notes in, said schedule XX of the general agreement, which are thus made a part of said exclusive trade agreement, are annexed to this proclamation;
Whereas
 I determine that the rates of duty and import tax specified in the column at the right of the respective descriptions of products in the following list are maximum rates which may be applied to such products of the Republic of Cuba under subparagraph (e) of numbered paragraph 2 of said exclusive trade agreement:
GENERAL NOTES
1. The provisions of this list shall be construed and given the same effect, and the application of collateral provisions of the customs laws of the United States to the provisions of this list shall be determined, insofar as may be practicable, as if each provision of this list appeared respectively in the statutory provision noted in the column at the left of the respective description of articles.
2. Any additional or separate ordinary customs duty provided for in respect of any article described in this list, whether or not imposed under the statutory provision indicated in the column at the left of the description of the article and whether or not temporarily or conditionally inapplicable, shall continue in force until terminated in accordance with law, subject to any reduction, or consolidation with the primary duty, indicated in this list or hereafter provided for, and subject to any temporary or conditional exemption therefrom now or hereafter provided for by law.
Whereas,
 in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph (c) of numbered paragraph 2 of said exclusive trade agreement, I determine (a) that the products provided for by the descriptions in the following list are products not described in the 8th recital of this proclamation, which would have been subject to ordinary customs duty if imported as products of the Republic of Cuba on April 10, 1947, disregarding any temporary or conditional exemptions, and which either are not described in said schedule XX of the general agreement or are described in part I thereof and the concessions thereon are identified in the 8th recital of the proclamation by the President of December 16, 1947, and are of a kind which were imported into the United States of America as products of the Republic of Cuba in any quantity during any of the calendar years 1937, 1939, 1944, and 1945, and (b) that the rates of duty and import tax specified in the column at the right of the respective descriptions of products are the rates of such products of the Republic of Cuba which conform to the provisions of said subparagraph (c):

Whereas
 said exchange of notes of December 19 and 22, 1947 provides that said exclusive trade agreement shall enter into force on January 1, 1948;

Whereas,
 Pursuant to the authority conferred by said Section 350, the President entered into an exclusive trade agreement with the President of the Republic of Cuba on August 24, 1934 (49 Stat.

And Whereas, 
numbered paragraph 1 of said exclusive trade agreement, said exchange of notes of December 19 and 22, 1947, and one of said exchanges of letters of October 30, 1947 provide that the Convention of Commercial Reciprocity between the United States of America and the Republic of Cuba, signed December 11, 1902 (33 Stat. (pt. 2) 2136 to 2142) and said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 12th recital of this proclamation, with its accompanying exchange of notes (49 Stat.
