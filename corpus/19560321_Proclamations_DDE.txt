A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 more than 14,000 farm residents—men, women, and children—lose their lives each year as the result of accidents; and
Whereas
 there were more accidental deaths among farm workers last year than occurred among the workers of any other major industry; and
Whereas
 in nearly every case human failure is associated with this appalling loss of life; and
Whereas
 experience in industry has proved that accident-prevention measures always pay—in less suffering and sorrow and in fewer injuries and deaths; and
Whereas
 the annual observance of Farm Safety Week has done much to direct national attention to the need for constant observance throughout the year of adequate safety precautions on the part of all residents and workers on the farm:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 22, 1956, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urgently request all farm workers and those who reside on farms to adopt safe practices that will make every day safety day on the farm.
I also request all persons and organizations interested in the welfare of farm people to join in this annual campaign to reduce the tragic loss of life.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
