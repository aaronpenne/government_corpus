A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the prime requisite for retaining our freedom is unswerving devotion to the liberties embodied in our Constitution; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that a special day be set aside for solemn re-evaluation of those priceless gifts of freedom which are our heritage, to the end that we may stimulate and renew that high sense of patriotism which has signalized our glorious history as a Nation; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved April 27, 1955, has set aside May 1, 1955, as Loyalty Day and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling upon the people to observe that day by reaffirming their loyalty to our beloved country:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request all our citizens to observe Sunday, May 1, 1955, as Loyalty Day with suitable ceremonies. I also request the appropriate officials to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States upon all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 28th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
