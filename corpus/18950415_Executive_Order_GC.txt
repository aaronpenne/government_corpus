Whereas on November 2, 1894, Departmental Rule II, section 4, Customs Rule II, section 6, Postal Rule II, section 6, Railway Mail Rule II, section 6, were amended to declare that no person appointed to a place under any exception to examination should be transferred from such place to another place not also excepted from examination; and
Whereas it was not my intention that these several amendments should be retroactive in their effect:
I therefore direct that the word "hereafter" be inserted after the word "person" in the first line. of each of said sections as of the date of said amendments, viz, November 2, 1894.
