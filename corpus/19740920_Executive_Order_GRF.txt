By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, and in the interest of protecting the right of taxpayers to privacy and confidentiality regarding their tax affairs consistent with proper internal management of the Government, and in the further interest of maintaining the integrity of the self-assessment system of Federal taxation, it is hereby ordered that any return, as defined in Section 301.6103 (a)-1 of the Treasury Regulations on Procedure and Administration (26 CFR Part 301) as amended from time to time, made by a taxpayer in respect of any tax described in Section 301.6103 (a)-1(a) (2) of such regulations shall be delivered to or open to inspection by the President only upon written request signed by the President personally. 
Any such request for delivery or inspection shall be addressed to the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate and shall state: (i) the name and address of the taxpayer whose return is to be inspected, (ii) the kind of return or returns which are to be inspected, and (iii) the taxable period or periods covered by such return or returns. 
In any such request for delivery or inspection, the President may designate by name an employee or employees of the White House Office who are authorized on behalf of the President to receive any such return or make such inspection, provided that the President will not so designate an employee unless such employee is the holder of a Presidential commission whose annual rate of basic pay equals or exceeds the annual rate of basic pay prescribed by 5 U.S.C. 5316. No disclosure of such return, or any data contained therein or derived therefrom shall be made by such employee except to the President, without the written direction of the President. 
All persons obtaining access to such return, or any data contained therein or derived therefrom shall in all respects be subject to the provisions of 26 U.S.C. 6103, as amended.
