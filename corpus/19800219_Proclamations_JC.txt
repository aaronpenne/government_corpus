By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Small business has long played a vital role in our Nation's economy and way of life. This past January, I was honored to participate in the first White House Conference on Small Business. I had the opportunity to hear firsthand, the ideas, problems and aspirations of men and women from the small business community. As a former small businessman, I was impressed with their energy, determination, and above all, their hope for the future of our country. 
The small business community constitutes the single most important segment of our free enterprise system. It accounts for forty-eight percent of our gross national product, more than half of the American labor force, and continues to be the major source of inventions and new jobs. 'Small business is truly the backbone of the American economy. I urge my fellow citizens to learn more about its role and importance in our society. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 11, 1980, as Small Business Week, and I urgently call on every American to join me in this very special tribute. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
