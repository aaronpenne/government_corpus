By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
"I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the Republic for which it stands . . ." From earliest school days most Americans know these words as they know their own names. They constitute a solemn promise of loyalty signed in the heart and paid off lifelong in the currency of daily deeds, great and smallâ€”from the ultimate sacrifice of the soldier, to the conscientious vote of the citizen, to the productive labor of the working man or woman and the precious trust of the parent. Once again this May 1, we pause as a nation to ask ourselves how we can live our loyalty better.
Loyalty Day, although a far newer national observance than Independence Day, is in a sense equally important. Our July 4 celebration of the "unalienable rights" which America owes to each of us has meaning only as we balance it with lively awareness of the unalienable allegiance which each of us in turn owes to America.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, in accordance with the joint resolution of the Congress of July 18, 1958, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic and educational organizations, to observe Monday, May 1, 1972, as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in schools and other suitable places.
I further call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day in witness of our "allegiance . . . to the Republic for which it stands."
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 22nd day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
