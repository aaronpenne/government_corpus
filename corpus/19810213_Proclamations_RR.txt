By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Agriculture is among America's most vital and far-reaching industries. Its production, processing, and marketing segments together provide as many as 17 million jobs. 
The productivity and efficiency of American agriculture are basic ingredients in our national strength. Agricultural productivity is a major weapon in the war against inflation and in the struggle to eliminate world hunger. The efficiency of the American farmer is the envy of the world. 
American farmers are, in reality, fiercely independent businessmen whose job it is to provide food and fiber. With the profit motive and freedom of enterprise, these businessmen of the soil have supplied this Nation with an abundance never before witnessed in the history of man. 
Today, our farmers are also making enormous contributions to America's trade balance. In the past year alone, farm exports amounted to $41 billion. 
To achieve a better understanding of, and appreciation for, agriculture's role in the Nation's way of life and of each individual's stake in a reliable food and fiber supply, the Congress enacted a Joint Resolution, Public Law 96-416, to set aside March 19, 1981, as "National Agriculture Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim March 19, 1981, "National Agriculture Day" and do call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
