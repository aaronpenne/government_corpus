A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the maximum participation of our citizens in the elective process is a basic need for the development of our democracy; and 
Whereas
 within our voting-age population there are considerably more women than men; and 
Whereas
 the participation of American women in past elections has not been as great as that of men; and 
Whereas
 the League of Women Voters and other dedicated groups of our citizens have been undertaking special programs to ensure an increased participation of women in our elections: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning September 13, 1964, as Women Voters Week; and I urge that a special effort be made during this week to ensure maximum registration of qualified women. 
I also invite and urge all local election officials throughout the United States to join with private citizens and citizen organizations to publicize registration arrangements during that week and during the whole of the pre-election registration period so as to bring the greatest possible number of our citizens to the polls on November 3. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eleventh day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State.
