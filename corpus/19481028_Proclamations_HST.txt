A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 November 11, 1948, marks the thirtieth anniversary of the signing of the Armistice which terminated hostilities between lawless aggressors on one side and defenders of freedom and peace on the other; and
Whereas
 less than a generation after the first World War the peace of the earth was shattered by the same aggressive forces, so that peace-loving men were once again compelled to defend themselves and their ideals by force of arms; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that on this anniversary we rededicate ourselves as unflagging and perpetual advocates of those principles for which we fought; and
Whereas
 the Congress passed a concurrent resolution on June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), calling for the observance of November 11 with appropriate ceremonies, in schools or churches, or other suitable places, and later provided in an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), that this date should be celebrated and known as Armistice Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe November 11, 1948, as Armistice Day by renewing their devotion to the cause of enduring peace; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
