By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Accidental poisoning has been killing fewer young children over the past several years.
Intensive educational efforts and labeling procedures have reduced the toll of young lives. Professional groups, industrial and trade associations, service organizations, and government agencies have worked together to make parents more aware of the potential hazards of medicines and commonly used household products.
Congress authorized this poison prevention campaign in a joint resolution of September 26, 1961 (75 Stat. 681), and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating the third week in March as National Poison Prevention Week.
Hopefully, as year-round preventive activities are increased even more lives may be saved and serious injuries averted.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning March 16, 1969, as National Poison Prevention Week.
I direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government, and I invite State and local governments and organizations, to participate actively in programs designed to promote better protection against accidental poisonings, particularly as they relate to young children.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
