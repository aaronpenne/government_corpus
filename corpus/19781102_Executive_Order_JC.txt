CREATING AN EMERGENCY BOARD To INVESTIGATE A DISPUTE BETWEEN WIEN AIR ALASKA, INC. AND CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS 
A dispute exists between Wien Air Alaska, Inc., and certain individuals represented by the Air Line Pilots Association, a labor organization. 
Section 44 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-504) directed that the provisions of Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, be invoked despite the fact that the National Mediation Board has failed to find that the dispute in its judgment substantially threatens to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service. 
Now, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me by Section 44 of the Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 (Public Law 95-504) it is hereby ordered as follows: 
1-101. Establishment of Board. There is established a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate this dispute. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of airline employees or any carrier. 
1-102. Report. The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days from the date of this Order.
