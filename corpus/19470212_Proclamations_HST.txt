A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American National Red Cross, traditional friend and counselor of the serviceman and the veteran, furnishes comfort and renewed hope to our sick and wounded in hospitals and provides morale-building welfare and recreational facilities for our occupation forces abroad as well as a wide range of services to those returning to civilian life in this country; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross, chartered by Congress and equipped by experience to cope with human needs when disaster strikes, performs its errands of mercy with skill and expedition; and
Whereas
 the Red Cross is devoting increased attention to its home-nursing and first-aid programs which are designed through training courses to check the spread of disease and to reduce the frightful toll of accidents; and
Whereas
 this organization is entirely dependent upon the voluntary contributions of the people of the United States in rendering these services, and has estimated that a minimum fund of $60,000,000 will be necessary for the implementation of its philanthropic program in 1947:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America and President of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate and proclaim the month of March 1947 as Red Cross Month and urge every citizen of this country to respond generously to this essential, humanitarian cause.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

G. C. MARSHALL,
Secretary of State.
