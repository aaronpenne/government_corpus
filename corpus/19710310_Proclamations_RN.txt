By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In this time as throughout our history, the American nation rests fully and finally_ upon the loyalty of the American people.
Every day Americans around the globe bear witness to their national allegiance. In doing so, some bear final witness by giving up their lives for the life of this Nation. Not all are called to that extremity. But all are called to that degree of devotion. For that reason it is fitting that we set aside one day in the year when every citizen may pause to reflect on his own debt to the devotion of other Americans, and to bear witness in every appropriate way to his own loyalty.
To that end the Congress by a joint resolution of July 18, 1958, has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of the United States, and upon all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, to observe Saturday, May 1, 1971 as Loyalty Day, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of us may join in a reaffirmation of our loyalty to the United States of America.
I also call upon appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
