By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
A nation derives its soul, strength, and character from the sum of the creative efforts of all its citizens. While we are a nation of more than 230 million individuals, we are one peopleâ€”interdependent on each other for our accomplishments and our future. 
We owe a special debt of gratitude to our older citizens, who have enriched, and continue to enrich, our great nation. Older Americans from all walks of life have played a major role in creating the bounties of life that bless us all. 
As we have come to appreciate the reservoir of experience and depth of knowledge possessed by our older citizens, we must recognize the importance of continuing to draw on them. Older Americans have much to give, both through employment and volunteer work. In paying homage to the contributions and continued potential of older Americans, we also recognize there are those among them who require assistance from others to enhance the quality of their golden years. 
As a nation, we are aging together. Opportunities and support we can provide to older Americans today will benefit all of us tomorrow. I urge all Americans to join in this call for intergenerational action that will make more meaningful the lives and potential of older Americans and our society as a whole. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May, 1982, as Older Americans Month. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of April, in the Year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth. 
RONALD REAGAN
