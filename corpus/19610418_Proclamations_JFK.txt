A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 active participation by youth in appropriate physical activities contributes to their fitness and to the maintenance of our national vigor and vitality; and 
Whereas
 Little Leagues in communities throughout the Nation have made it possible for thousands of young boys to take an active part in our national game of baseball; and 
Whereas
 Little League baseball not only promotes the physical well-being of the players, but also instills into them the qualities of fairness, cooperation, and discipline-qualities which contribute to the development of good citizenship; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Concurrent Resolution 17, agreed to June 1, 1959, has requested the President to designate the week beginning the second Monday in June of each year as National Little League Baseball Week, in recognition of the national and community benefits resulting from Little League activity: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning the second Monday in June of 1961, and the week beginning the second Monday in June of each succeeding year, as National Little League Baseball Week. 
And I invite the people of the United States to observe that week in schools, parks, athletic fields, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies and activities designed to emphasize the importance of the physical development of our Nation's youth. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighteenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
