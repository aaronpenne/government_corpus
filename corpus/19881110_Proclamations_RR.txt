By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
More than 40 years after the end of World War II, America is a Nation proud, strong, and at peace. We should be ever mindful, however, that the peace and the freedom we now enjoy have been won through the sacrifices of those who served during times of conflict. 
Many courageous Americans fought long and arduously to stop the Japanese advance in the Far East during World War II. These patriots surely deserve our admiration and respect. We should especially recognize the heroism and unwavering purpose of those who took part in the battles and campaigns of the China-Burma-India Theater of Operations, scene of some of the most intense fighting during the war. Thousands risked their lives to transport military supplies across rugged and treacherous terrain after the fall of Burma and the loss of the famous Burma supply route in 1942. Many others flew with the U.S. Air Transport Command over a 500-mile route, the "Hump," which stretched over the Himalayas from India to Western China. When the first supplies were brought into China over the "Stilwell Road" in 1945, a victory was won for all free nations. 
It is most fitting that on Veterans Day weekend, 1988, we acknowledge the special contributions made by these fellow citizens in our country's cause. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim November 12, 1988, as National China-Burma-India Veterans Appreciation Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.
RONALD REAGAN
