Mrs. McLanaham, after twelve years' service, was separated from the position of sewer in the Government Printing Office prior to her marriage in 1894. In June, 1903, she was left a widow with three children to support. In view of her unfortunate circumstances and previous efficient service attested by the Public Printer, the Commission recommended to the President a special order waiving the rule requiring reinstatement within one year, which was approved by the President July 25, 1903.
