A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the people of this Nation are grateful to the veterans of our Armed Forces who have faithfully discharged the duties of citizenship and nobly served in times of national peril; and
Whereas
 among the resources from which our country draws her strength we hold in high esteem the more than twenty-two million living veterans of our military, naval, and air services, and we treasure the freedom preserved for us by the sacrifice of many; and
Whereas
 the Congress by an Act approved June 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 168), expanded the significance of November 11, theretofore declared a legal holiday and observed as Armistice Day, by designating it as Veterans Day in honor of our veterans:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon our citizens to observe Monday, November 11, 1957, as Veterans Day, in tribute to those who have thus added strength to the Nation and in renewed dedication to their work, building peace with honor among all nations.
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 21st day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
