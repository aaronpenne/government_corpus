A Proclamation
 
Whereas in the opening of the Cherokee Outlet, pursuant to section ten, of the act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, the lands known as the Eastern, Middle, and Western Saline Reserves, were excepted from settlement in view of three leases made by the Cherokee Nation prior to March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, under authority of the act of Congress, approved August seventh, eighteen hundred and eighty-two;
And whereas it appears that said leases were never approved as provided by law;
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section ten of said act of March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, do hereby declare and make known that all the lands in said saline reserves, as described in a proclamation dated August nineteenth, eighteen hundred and ninety-three, are hereby restored to the public domain and will be disposed of under the laws of the United States relating to public lands in said Cherokee Outlet, subject to the policy of the Government in disposing of saline lands.
In witness whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 27th day of July, in the year of our Lord, one thousand eight hundred and ninety-eight; and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-third.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY

WILLIAIM R. DAY,
