By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Section 1903 of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988 (the 1988 Act) (Public Law No. 100-418, 102 Stat. 1313) amends section 503(c)(1)(B) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the 1974 Act) (19 U.S.C. 2463(c)(1)(B)) to provide for the continued exclusion of watches as eligible articles under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) except those watches entered after June 30, 1989, that the President specifically determines, after public notice and comment, will not cause material injury to watch or watch band, strap, or bracelet manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or the United States insular possessions. 
2. Pursuant to Title V of the 1974 Act, as amended (19 U.S.C. 2461 et seq.), the President may designate specified articles provided for in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (HTS) as eligible for preferential tariff treatment under the GSP when imported from designated beneficiary developing countries. 
3. Pursuant to section 503(c)(1)(B) of the 1974 Act, as amended, I have determined that the addition of certain specified watches (HTS subheadings in Annex I to this Proclamation) as articles eligible for preferential treatment under the GSP will not cause material injury to watch or watch band, strap, or bracelet manufacturing and assembly operations in the United States or the United States insular possessions. 
4. Pursuant to sections 501 and 503(a) of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2461 and 2463(a)), I have determined, after taking into account information and advice received under section 503(a) of the 1974 Act, that it is appropriate to designate certain specified watches provided for in the HTS as eligible for preferential treatment under the GSP. 
5. Section 201(a) of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement Implementation Act of 1988 (the Implementation Act) (Public Law No. 100-449, 102 Stat. 1851) authorizes the President to proclaim such modifications or continuance of any existing duties, such continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment, or such additional duties, as the President determines are necessary or appropriate to carry out Article 401 of the United States-Canada Free-Trade Agreement and the schedule of duty reductions with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada set forth in Annexes 401.2 and 401.7 to the Agreement. 
6. Pursuant to section 201(a) of the Implementation Act, I have determined that it is necessary to provide for the continued staged reduction in duties on certain goods originating in the territory of Canada. 
7. Section 604 of the 1974 Act (19 U.S.C. 2483) authorizes the President to embody in the HTS the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to Title V and section 604 of the 1974 Act, and section 201 of the Implementation Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) In order to provide benefits under the GSP to specified designated eligible articles when imported from any designated beneficiary developing country, the HTS is modified as provided in Annex I to this Proclamation. 
(2) In order to provide for the continued staged reductions on Canadian goods in particular HTS subheadings modified in Annex I to this Proclamation, effective with respect to certain goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates specified in Annex II to this Proclamation, the rate of duty in the HTS set forth in the Rates of Duty 1-Special subcolumn followed by the symbol "CA" in parentheses for each of the HTS subheadings enumerated in such Annex II shall be deleted and the rate of duty provided in such Annex shall be inserted in lieu thereof. 
(3) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this Proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. 
(4) (a) The amendments made by Annex I of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date that is 14 days after the publication of this Proclamation in the Federal Register. 
(b) The amendments made by Annex II of this Proclamation shall be effective with respect to goods originating in the territory of Canada which are entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the dates specified in such Annex. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
