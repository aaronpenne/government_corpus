(2) The Tariff Schedules of the United States shall be modified, with respect to each item identified in the annex to this proclamation, to provide for such item, effective on and after July 1, 1967, the continuation, until modified or amended, of the rate of duty set forth opposite thereto in the annex.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
