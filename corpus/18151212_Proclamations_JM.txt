By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas it has been represented that many uninformed or persons have taken possession of or made a settlement on the lands of the United States which have not been previously sold, or leased by the United States, or the claim to which lands by persons has not been previously recognized or confirmed by the States, which possession or settlement is by the act of Congress passed on the 3d day of March, 1807, expressly prohibited; and
Whereas the due execution of the said act of Congress, as well as the general interest, requires that such illegal practices should be promptly repressed:
Now, therefore, I, James Madison, President of the United States, have thought proper to issue my proclamation commanding and strictly enjoining all persons who have unlawfully taken possession of or made any settlement on the public lands as aforesaid forthwith to remove therefrom; and I do hereby further command and enjoin the marshal, or officer acting as marshal, in any State or Territory where such possession shall have been taken or settlement made to remove, from and after the 10th day of March, 1816, all or any of the said unlawful occupants; and to effect the said service I do hereby authorize the employment of such military force as may become necessary in pursuance of the provisions of the act of Congress aforesaid, warning the offenders, moreover, that they will be prosecuted in all such other ways as the law directs.
In testimony whereof I have caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed to these presents, and signed the same with my hand.
Done at the city of Washington, the 12th day of December, A. D. 1815, and of the Independence of the said United States of America the fortieth.
JAMES MADISON.
By the President:
JAMES MONROE,
 Secretary of State.
