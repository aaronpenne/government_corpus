A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 January 1, 1963, marks the centennial of the Proclamation in which President Abraham Lincoln declared all persons held as slaves in States or parts of States still in rebellion to be "then, thenceforward, and forever free"; and 
Whereas
 the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation marked the beginning of the end of the iniquitous institution of slavery in the United States, and a great stride toward the fulfillment of the principle of the Declaration of Independence that "all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness"; and
Whereas
 the Emancipation Proclamation and the 13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the Constitution of the United States guaranteed to Negro citizens equal rights with all other citizens of the United States and have made possible great progress toward the enjoyment of those rights; and 
Whereas
 the goal of equal rights for all our citizens is still unreached, and the securing of these rights is one of the great unfinished tasks of our democracy: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim that the Emancipation Proclamation expresses our Nation's policy, rounded on justice and morality, and that it is therefore fitting and proper to commemorate the centennial of the historic Emancipation Proclamation throughout the year 1963. 
I call upon the Governors of the States, mayors of cities, and other public officials, as well as private persons, organizations, and groups, to observe the centennial by appropriate ceremonies. 
I request the United States Commission on Civil Rights to plan and participate in appropriate commemorative activities recognizing the centennial of the issuance of the Emancipation Proclamation; and I also request the Commission on Civil Rights and other Federal agencies to cooperate fully with State and local governments during 1963 in commemorating these events. 
I call upon all citizens of the United States and all officials of the United States and of every State and local government to dedicate themselves to the completion of the task of assuring that every American, regardless of his race, religion, color, or national origin, enjoys all the rights guaranteed by the Constitution and laws of the United States. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed this 28th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
