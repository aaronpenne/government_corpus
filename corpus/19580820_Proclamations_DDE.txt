A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 with respect for the God-given dignity of each individual and in keeping with the American tradition of helping others to help themselves, we appreciate the importance of useful employment; and
Whereas
 our physically handicapped citizens want to make their maximum contribution to the strength of our land and they have proved their ability as skilled and productive workers; and
Whereas
 the continued development of our country requires an ever-enlarging effort by all our people: both able-bodied and physically handicapped; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), has designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation each year calling for the observance of that week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 5, 1958, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week.
I also call upon the Governors of States, mayors of municipalities, Federal and other public officials, leaders of industry and labor, and members of all concerned organizations to take part in this observance. I particularly urge all employers to give the physically handicapped equal consideration for retention in their Jobs as well as for employment, and I request our citizens to remember, throughout the year, that by their interest and assistance many handicapped persons can achieve economic independence and active participation in the total life of the national community.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 20th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
