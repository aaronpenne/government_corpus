By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
All Americans, and a sizeable portion of the rest of the world's people, depend upon American agriculture for much of their food and fiber. Anything that diminishes the ability of farmers and ranchers to meet these vital needs is of great concern. Farm accidents are among the costliest impediments to production and cause great suffering and economic loss. 
Accidents can destroy the lives and bodies, as well as the economic resources of farm families. Neither the individuals involved, nor the Nation, can afford these losses. Farm safety leaders believe that most farm accidents could be prevented with greater care in controlling hazards and unsafe practices?the same kind of dedicated, careful management and attention to detail that has made possible our incredible increase in agricultural production. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 25, 1978, as National Farm Safety Week. I call upon the men and women who operate the Nation's farms and ranches to regard safety as an integral part of all their activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
