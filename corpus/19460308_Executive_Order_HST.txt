WHEREAS a dispute exists between The Alton Railroad Company and other carriers, as set forth in the list attached hereto and made a part hereof, and certain of their employees represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, labor organizations; and
WHEREAS the dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS the dispute, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive the country of essential transportation service:
NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate said dispute. No member of the said board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railway employees or any carrier.
The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the said dispute within thirty days from the date of this order.
As provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by The Alton Railroad Company and the other carriers, or their employees in the condition out of which the said dispute arose.
