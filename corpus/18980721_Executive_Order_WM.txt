In view of the occupation of Santiago de Cuba by the forces of the United States, it is ordered that postal communication between the United States and that port, which has been suspended since the opening of hostilities with Spain, may be resumed, subject to such military regulations as may be deemed necessary.
As other portions of the enemy's territory conic into the possession of the land and naval forces of the United States, postal communication may be opened under the same conditions.
The domestic postal service within the territory thus occupied may be continued on the same principles already indicated for the continuance of the local municipal and judicial administration, and it may be extended as the local requirements may justify, under the supervision of the military commander.
The revenues derived from such service are to be applied to the expenses of conducting it, and the United States postage stamps are therefore to be used.
The Postmaster-General is charged with the execution of this order in co-operation with the military commander, to whom the Secretary of War will issue the necessary directions.
