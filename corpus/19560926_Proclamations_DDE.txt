A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 four hundred and sixty-four years ago Christopher Columbus, seeking a short route to Asia, fearlessly set sail from Spain, crossed an uncharted and unknown sea, and found instead a vast new world; and
Whereas
 the passing of the centuries has not dimmed the glory of his exploits, which continue to inspire and encourage all of us who are his heirs to seek broader fields of endeavor and new ways of understanding our planet and its peoples; and
Whereas
, in recognition of the vision, the daring, and the achievements of Christopher Columbus, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657), requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 12 of each year as Columbus Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Friday, October 12, 1956, as Columbus Day, and I invite the people of this Nation to observe the day with ceremonies commemorative of the sighting of land by Columbus and his crew on their westward voyage in 1492. I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Columbus Day in honor of the great discoverer.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my 1u2d and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
