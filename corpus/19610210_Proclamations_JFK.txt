A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on April 14, 1961, the peoples of the American Republics will honor the seventy-first anniversary of the founding of an organization for inter-American cooperation, now known as the Organization of American States; and 
Whereas
 the people of the United States view with sympathy and urgency the aspirations of their good neighbors of this Hemisphere for a way of life which promises increased political, spiritual, cultural, and economic well-being; and 
Whereas
 the ideals of peace, freedom, and human progress are again threatened by forces intent on subverting them, and a rededication of those determined to strengthen the inter-American system is required; and 
Whereas
 the United States of America is proud to participate within the framework of the inter-American system in the formulation of new co-operative measures for social improvement and economic development to help meet the desires of the peoples of this Hemisphere for a better way of life and to preserve and strengthen the free and democratic institutions in the American Republics: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, April 14, 1961, as Pan American Day, and the period from April 9 to April 15, 1961, as Pan American Week; and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
I also urge our citizens and all interested organizations to share in the celebration of Pan American Day and Pan American Week, in testimony of the historical ties and friendly relations which unite the people of this country with the peoples of other American Republics. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
