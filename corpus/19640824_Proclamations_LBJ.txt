A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the united efforts of parents and of the professions serving children and youth through our voluntary and governmental agencies give American boys and girls a greater chance for longer, healthier life; and 
Whereas
 scientific research has shown ways to conquer or prevent many of the crippling diseases that were once the universal scourge of childhood; and 
Whereas
 medical progress now makes it possible for millions of American children to enjoy physical, emotional, and spiritual growth to healthy adulthood; and 
Whereas
 pride in past accomplishments underscores the daily challenge to continue and expand these efforts to benefit children in our own country and throughout the world; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928, 45 Stat. 617, as amended by a joint resolution of September 22, 1959, 73 Stat. 627 (36 U.S.C. 143), requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the first Monday in October as Child Health Day; and 
Whereas
 Child Health Day is an appropriate time to observe a Universal Children's Day and to salute the work of the United Nations and the efforts of its specialized agencies and of the United Nations Children's Fund to build better health for children around the world: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday October 5, 1964, as Child Health Day; and I invite all persons and all agencies and organizations interested in the welfare of youth to mark that day with activities which will help promote opportunities for all children to attain an adulthood that will be satisfying to them and will enhance their contribution to the progress of our society. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America, to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day of August in the year of our Nord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth.
