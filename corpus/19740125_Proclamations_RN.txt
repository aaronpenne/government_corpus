By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential proclamations on the quantities of wheat and milled wheat products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 are set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas,
 at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made an investigation under the authority of subsection (b) of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to determine whether the import quotas on wheat and milled wheat products provided for in item 950.60 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) may be suspended without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the loan and payment programs now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for wheat or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic wheat; and
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report with respect to this matter; and
Whereas,
 on the basis of such investigation and report, I find and declare that the entry of additional quantities of wheat and milled wheat products resulting from the suspension during the period ending June 30, 1974, of the quantitative limitations provided for in item 950.60 of the TSUS will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the loan and payment programs now being conducted by the Department of Agriculture for wheat and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic wheat, that the circumstances which required the imposition of such quantitative limitations on wheat and milled wheat products no longer exist, and that such quantitative limitations should be suspended during the period ending June 30, 1974;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that headnote 3 (a) of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended by adding a new subdivision as follows:
(ix) Notwithstanding any other provision of this part the quantitative limitations for the articles provided for in item 950.60 shall be suspended during the period beginning January 26, 1974, and ending June 30, 1974. Quantities of such articles entered during the period of May 29, 1974, through June 30, 1974, shall not be deducted from the quantities which may be entered during the twelve month period beginning May 29, 1974, under the quantitative limitations provided for in item 950.60.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
