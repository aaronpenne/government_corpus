A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the health, prosperity, and well-being of our rural families are vital to the strength of the Nation; and
Whereas
 accidents suffered by the rural inhabitants of our land result in thousands of injuries and deaths each year and constitute a serious social and economic problem; and
Whereas
 experience has shown that these accidents can be reduced through educational programs directed towards safety precautions in the homes, in the fields, and on the highways:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 20, 1958, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urge all farm families and all persons allied with agriculture to join in a continuing campaign to prevent needless accidents in the homes, in the fields, and on the highways.
I also request all persons and organizations interested in the welfare of farm people to support and participate in National Farm Safety Week.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 8th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
