By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 errors have been discovered in the description of the area now constituting the Sitka National Monument, Alaska, as contained in Proclamation No. 959 of March 23, 1910 (36 Stat. 2601), establishing the said monument; and
Whereas
 a certain tract of land adjoining the said monument has been donated to the United States to provide a suitable entrance to the monument, and a certain tract of public land near the monument is needed for the administration thereof; and
Whereas
 certain privately-owned lands adjoining the said monument are needed for the administration and protection thereof, and the United States desires to acquire such lands for such purposes; and
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to redefine the boundaries of the Sitka National Monument (1) to correct the above-mentioned errors of description, (2) to add to the monument the said tract donated to the United States and the said tract of public land, and (3) to include within the boundaries of the monument the said privately-owned lands, with a view to making such lands parts of the monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of Congress approved June 8, 1906, 34 Stat. 225 (16 U.S.C. 431), do proclaim that, subject to valid existing rights, (1) the lands now owned by the United States within the exterior boundaries of the following-described tracts of land shown on the diagram attached hereto and hereby made a part hereof shall constitute the Sitka National Monument, and (2) the privately-owned lands within such boundaries shall become parts of the monument upon acquisition of title thereto by the United States:
