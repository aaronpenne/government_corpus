By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, and as President of the United States and Commander-in-Chief of the armed forces of the United States, it is ordered that section 403 of Executive Order No. 10161 of September 9, 1950, as amended by Executive Order No. 10233 of April 24, 1951, be, and it is hereby, further amended by re-lettering paragraph (b) thereof as paragraph (c) and by inserting after paragraph (a) of such section 403 the following new paragraph:
"(b) In addition to the members of the Board provided for in section 403(a) of this Executive order, the Board shall have not more than six alternate members, who shall be appointed by the President at such times as he may deem necessary and for such periods of service as he shall prescribe. Not more than two of such alternate members shall be representative of the public, not more than two shall be representative of labor, and not more than two shall be representative of business and industry. Any alternate member shall participate as a member of the Board only in lieu of a member appointed under section 403(a) who is not participating, and only when called upon by the Chairman of the Board to so participate, and when so participating each alternate member shall have the same status and functions as a member appointed under section 403(a) of this Executive order. The designation by the Chairman of the Board of alternate members to participate as members of the Board shall be so ordered as to preserve the equal representation contemplated by the provisions of section 403(a) of this Executive order."
