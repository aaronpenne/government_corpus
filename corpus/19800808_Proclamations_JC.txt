By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American free enterprise system, the cornerstone of our Nation's economy, has endured and flourished for more than 200 years. It provides us with one of the highest standards of living in the world, and guarantees freedom of choice in a way that sets us apart among nations. 
It is a system that depends upon and rewards initiative and innovation, a system that offers opportunities to Americans from all walks of life, a system whose benefits accrue to each of us. 
Today, our free enterprise system is buffeted by changes both at home and abroad. Inflation, the energy crisis, growing competition in world markets--all challenge our resourcefulness. To preserve the health of our system and our position in the international economy, we must work together to increase productivity by developing and implementing new techniques for the more effective use of raw materials, energy, machines, and our own labor. In the process, we will reaffirm our confidence in the American future.
In recognition of the importance of our enterprise system, the Congress in Senate Joint Resolution 109 has requested the proclamation of October 3, 1980, as American Enterprise Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 3, 1980, as American Enterprise Day, and I urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, professional, consumer and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe American Enterprise Day with appropriate activities that promote appreciation of the American free enterprise system and its benefits. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
JIMMY CARTER
