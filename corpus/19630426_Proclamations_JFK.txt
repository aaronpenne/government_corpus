A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 17, 1963, marks the one hundred and seventy-sixth anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787; and 
Whereas
 the strength of our Nation and the fundamental rights of our citizens are derived from the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 citizenship and constitutional precepts are inseparable; and 
Whereas
, in this rapidly changing world of many challenges, it is imperative that all citizens, naturalized or native-born, be aware of the acts and events that led to the formulation and adoption of the Constitution in order that they may fully appreciate the meaning and significance of our precious heritage and place the highest value on, our form of government; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate on the one hundred and seventy-sixth anniversary of the signing of the Constitution that each citizen pledge himself anew to the service of his country and to being ever vigilant in the defense and preservation of the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of those citizens who have come of age and those who have been naturalized during the year; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved August 2, 1956 (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week-a time for the study and observance of the acts and events which resulted in the formation of the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 those resolutions of the Congress authorize the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day and of Constitution Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America., call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1963; and I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies on that day to inspire all our citizens to rededicate themselves to the faith of the Framers of the Constitution and to the ideals upon which they founded this Nation. 
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1963, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches and in other suitable places to the end that our citizens may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the rights and responsibilities of Unite States citizenship. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and, of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
