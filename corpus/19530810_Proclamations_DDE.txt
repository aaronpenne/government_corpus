A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 opportunities for suitable and gainful employment are the hope and ambition of all workers, and the American system of free choice of occupations, consistent with each worker's abilities and interests, is best suited to provide such opportunities; and
Whereas
 a great many physically handicapped workers presently employed have proved the competence of such workers when they have been rehabilitated or otherwise properly prepared for suitable jobs; and
Whereas
 there is a continuing need for greater understanding of effective methods for the placement of physically handicapped workers in suitable occupations, and community participation in educational and promotional programs can best accomplish this purpose; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), has designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling public attention to the need for Nation-wide support of and interest in the employment of otherwise qualified but physically handicapped men and women:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 4, 1953, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped in carrying out the purposes of the aforementioned joint resolution of Congress.
I also request the Governors of States, the mayors of municipalities, other public officials, leaders of industry and labor, and members of religious, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, handicapped-persons', and fraternal organizations, as well as other groups representative of our national life, to take part in the observance of the designated week, in order to enlist the widest possible support of programs designed to increase opportunities in employment for the physically handicapped.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
