A Proclamation
 
To the People of the United States:
 
The Nation has lost one of its most preeminent elder sages. Charles Evans Hughes, who died at Osterville, Massachusetts, last night, will be counted in the long perspective of history not only as one of the most highly esteemed statesmen of our time, but indeed as among the most distinguished of the men who have devoted themselves to the public weal since the origin of our country. 
Humanitarian understanding, exalted vision, and inspired judgment characterized the long career of Charles Evans Hughes, who served the people of New York State as Governor and the people of the Nation as Associate Justice of the Supreme Court, as Secretary of State, and as Chief Justice of the United States. 
The whole world needs and will continue to need statesmen and citizens capable of viewing the march of events objectively and adhering firmly to the reasonable and just. In view of that need, we should all long remember this superb example of a life dedicated to reason and to justice in human affairs. 
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 president of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be flown at half mast on all Government buildings until after the funeral services for Charles Evans Hughes shall have been concluded, and I request the people of the United States to render every appropriate reverence to this great American, in their homes, their schools, their churches, and in other suitable places. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this twenty-eighth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
