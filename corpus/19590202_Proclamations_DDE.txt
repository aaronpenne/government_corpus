A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego County, California, was established by Proclamation No. 1255 of October 14, 1913 (38 Stat. 1965), on approximately one-half acre of land that, along with other lands, had been set aside for military purposes by an order approved by the President on February 26, 1852; and

 the present area of the monument is not adequate for the proper care and management of the historical landmarks and historical objects situated therein; and
