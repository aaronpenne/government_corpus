By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On April 14, the United States will join in commemorating the establishment of the International Union of American Republics. The 84th anniversary of that event finds the United States and other members of the Organization of American States, the descendant of the International Union of American Republics, actively working together to fashion the Inter-American System into a constructive, cooperative force which will bring mutual understanding and mutual assistance.
We are moving toward this goal despite the diversity of our cultural heritages and national characteristics and despite tensions and differences which have occurred from time to time. We do this, knowing, as a former Secretary of State of the United States, Elihu Root, once said:
"There is not one of all our countries that cannot benefit the others; there is not one that will not gain by the prosperity, the peace and the happiness of all."
The Americas of today are joined in the common effort to bring about progress and well-being for all so that those who follow us will enjoy the fruits of a new inter-American order based on justice, security, and peace.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, April 14, 1974 as Pan American Day, and the week beginning April 14 and ending April 20 as Pan American Week, and I call upon the Governors of the fifty States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
