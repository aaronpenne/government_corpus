WHEREAS disputes exist between the carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees, designated in List A attached hereto and made a part hereof and certain of their employees represented by the Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, Brotherhood of Locomotive Firemen and Enginemen, Order of Railway Conductor's and Brakemen, Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, and the Switchmen's Union of North America, labor organizations; and 
WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended: and 
WHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service: 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily, or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any carrier. 
The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the disputes within thirty days from the date of this order. 
As provided by section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the carriers represented by the Eastern, Western, and Southeastern Carriers' Conference Committees, or by their employees, in the conditions out of which the disputes arose.
