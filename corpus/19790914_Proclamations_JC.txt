By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Diabetes mellitus affects the lives of 10 million Americans. Each year, 35,000 Americans die from this disease, and many times that number fall victim to heart attack, stroke, kidney failure, blood vessel disease and blindness related to diabetes. Diabetes now costs the country more than $6 billion annually in health care expenses, disability payments and lost wages. 
A major national effort is underway among Federal agencies, State and local governments, academic institutions and voluntary health organizations to combat diabetes and its complications, which so often compromise the quality of life of its victims. There is optimism in the scientific community that research is leading to greater understanding and improved methods of treatment for diabetes and its complications. We must continue to focus attention on the needs of the many victims of diabetes in the United States if we are ever to reduce the impact of this disease as a source of human suffering in our Nation. 
The Congress, by Joint Resolution enacted August 13, 1979 (Public Law 9651), has authorized and requested the President to designate the week of October 8 through October 14, 1979, as National Diabetes Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 8 through October 14, 1979, as National Diabetes Week. 
I call upon public and private agencies and organizations to recognize and observe it appropriately. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and officials of other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my band this fourteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
