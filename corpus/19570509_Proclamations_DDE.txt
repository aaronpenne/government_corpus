A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on May 13, 1607, three small ships landed at what is now Jamestown, on the James River, in Virginia, and from that landing grew the first permanent English settlement in the United States; and
Whereas
 at Jamestown legislative government representative of the people was transplanted to the New World; and
Whereas
 the significance of the Jamestown settlement of 1607, as the first step toward the creation of the American Nation, should be impressed on the hearts of all who love our country and the ideals for which it stands; and
Whereas
 this year marks the three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the Jamestown settlement, and the Nation looks back to the little island on the James River and marvels at the hardships endured by its pioneers in that untamed wilderness; and
Whereas
 this milestone is an occasion for national thanksgiving, in which the churches, the schools, and all who bear the responsibility for our Nation's continued leadership should join wholeheartedly.
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, May 13, 1957, as Jamestown Day, and I call upon all citizens to Join in commemorating the landing at Jamestown three hundred and fifty years ago.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
