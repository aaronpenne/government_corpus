A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 recreational boating has become a leading outdoor activity for millions of Americans who enjoy this healthful and relaxing use of leisure time; and 
Whereas
 education of the boating public in safe practices contributes to the enjoyment of the sport and reduces the likelihood of accidents; and 
Whereas
 continuing cooperation between organizations and individuals interested in boating is necessary to insure safe boating throughout the year; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, in recognizing the need for emphasis on boating safety, by a joint resolution, approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), has requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, do hereby designate the week beginning June 28, 1964, as National Safe Boating Week. 
In furtherance of the objectives of this proclamation, I strongly urge that all individuals; boating organizations, the boating industry, and Government agencies, both State and Federal, dedicated to safer recreational boating, publicize and observe National Safe Boating Week, and extend their effort throughout the year. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join in the observance of this Week in order to draw nation-wide attention to the importance of safety in recreational boating. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
