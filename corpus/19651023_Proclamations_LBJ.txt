A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 many of our people are now afflicted with Parkinson's disease and more than 25,000 additional persons become victims of that disease each year; and
Whereas
 Parkinson's disease is one of the most prevalent neurological disorders; and
Whereas
 the causes of Parkinson's disease are still unknown; and
Whereas
 many persons have dedicated themselves to treating and rehabilitating persons afflicted with Parkinson's disease and to conducting research into the cause or causes of that disease and a cure for it; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 23, 1965, has requested the President to designate the week beginning October 25, 1965, as National Parkinson Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 25, 1965, as National Parkinson Week. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
I also call upon the communications media, the medical and health professions, and all agencies and individuals interested in a national program for the control of Parkinson's disease to unite during that week in public dedication to such a program and in a concerted effort to impress upon the people of the United States the necessity for such a program.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 23rd day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
