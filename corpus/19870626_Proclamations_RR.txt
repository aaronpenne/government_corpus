By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
A quarter-century ago, in Colorado, Outward Bound began to provide rigorous outdoor recreational programs to young people to improve their self-confidence, sense of social responsibility, physical fitness, and outdoor skills. Since then, across our land, more than 150,000 people of all backgrounds, ages, and abilities have tackled the challenges offered by Outward Bound, and many similar experience-based programs have come into being. 
Every American can rightly celebrate the anniversary of this remarkable nonprofit organization, because it fosters love for the wilderness and strengthens our Nation by stressing the perseverance, teamwork, leadership , and goal-setting we all need to overcome obstacles and adversity and to discover our potential for achievement. 
In recognition of Outward Bound's significant role in recreation, conservation, and youth development, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 284, has designated the week beginning June 21, 1987, as "National Outward Bound Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in its observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 21, 1987, as National Outward Bound Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
