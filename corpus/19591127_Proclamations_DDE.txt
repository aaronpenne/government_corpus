By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 certain lands in the States of Alabama, Georgia, and Mississippi have been acquired by the United States under the authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act, approved June 16, 1933 (48 Stat. 202), the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, approved April 8, 1935 (49 Stat. 115), or Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, approved July 22, 1937 (50 Stat. 525), as amended (7 U.S.C. 1010-1012), for use in connection with the Tuskegee, Piedmont, North Central, Northeast Mississippi, and Natchez Trace Land Utilization Projects; and
Whereas
, by reason of the transfer effected by Executive Order No. 7908 of June 9, 1938, as amended by Executive Order No. 8531 of August 31, 1940, such projects are now being administered pursuant to Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act; and
Whereas
 it appears that such lands are suitable for national-forest purposes and that it would be in the public interest to reserve them as national forests; and
Whereas
 it appears desirable to include within the exterior boundaries of such national forests certain State and privately-owned lands which are so intermingled with the lands owned by the United States that segregation thereof is impracticable; and
Whereas
 some of such lands owned by the United States are under lease to Soil Conservation Districts or to individuals, and it is desirable that such leases remain in force and effect until terminated as provided therein:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 24 of the act of March 3, 1891, 26 Stat. 1103, as amended (16 U.S.C. 471), and upon recommendation of the Secretary of Agriculture, do proclaim that, subject to the aforementioned leases and other valid existing rights, there are hereby reserved and set apart as the Tuskegee National Forest, Alabama, the Oconee National Forest, Georgia, and the Tombigbee National Forest, Mississippi, respectively, all lands of the United States within the areas hereinafter described which have been acquired by the United States under authority of the National Industrial Recovery Act, the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935, or Title III of the Bankhead-Jones Farm Tenant Act, and which are being administered as parts of the aforementioned land utilization projects:
