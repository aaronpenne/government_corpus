By virtue of the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, and in order to provide flexibility in determining the length of White House Fellowships, it is hereby ordered that Section 3 of Executive Order No. 11183 of October 3, 1964, as amended, is further amended by deleting "12 months, beginning" and inserting in lieu thereof "a period to be set by the Commission, provided that such a period shall not exceed 365 days. Extensions of appointments may be granted by the Commission at any time after appointments are made, but such extensions shall not exceed 90 days. White House Fellows will begin their appointments". This Order is applicable to all Fellows with appointments commencing on or after September 1, 1987, and all such Fellows may be granted extensions of their original appointments so long as such extensions do not exceed 90 days.
