By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Americans enjoy the use of our Nation's highway system, which is one of the finest systems in the world, both for business and pleasure. Our highways are a source of pride for this Nation and they directly or indirectly affect and serve every American. Highways are our lifelinesâ€”providing us with food and other necessities, the opportunity to explore this vast, beautiful country, and a great freedom of choice in selecting our home and work areas. Highways have contributed significantly to employment, provided us improved lifestyles, and aided in our defense. Our highways should be recognized as a national asset and our citizens should be urged to clean up and rehabilitate them. Clean and litter-free highways will contribute to national pride and road safety. 
To remind all Americans of the importance of national pride and road safety, the Congress, by an Act approved June 5, 1981 (Public Law 97-12), has requested the President to proclaim June 28 through July 4 as National Clean-up and Flag-up America's Highways Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 28 through July 4, 1981, as National Cleanup and Flag-up America's Highways Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
