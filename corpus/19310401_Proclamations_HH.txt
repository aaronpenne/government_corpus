A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Congress by act of February 14, 1931 (Public, No. 667 - 71st Cong.), entitled "An act to authorize the President of the United States to establish the Canyon De Chelly National Monument within the Navajo Indian Reservation, Arizona," authorized the President of the United States, with the consent of the Tribal Council of the Navajo Tribe of Indians, to establish the said Canyon De Chelly National Monument by Executive proclamation; 
Whereas
 the Navajo Tribal Council Assembly at Fort Wingate, N. Mex., on July 8, 1930, adopted a resolution approving the establishment of the Canyon De Chelly National Monument; and 
Whereas
 it appears that the public interest would be promoted by including the lands hereinafter described within a national monument for the preservation of a great number of cliff dwellings and for their archaeological interest; 
Now, Therefore, I, Herbert Hoover,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by the said act of Congress approved February 14, 1931, do hereby proclaim and establish the Canyon De Chelly National Monument and that the following described lands in Arizona be, and the same are hereby, included within the said national monument:
