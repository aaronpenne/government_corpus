By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The millions of refugees and immigrants from Asia and the Pacific who braved the unknown and ventured to our Nation's shores have helped to write the story of America's success. Their legacy is a proud one, marked by significant achievements in the arts, science, education, and business. 
Today, Asian and Pacific Americans continue to enrich our life as a Nation. Through their efforts to preserve the traditions of their ancestral homelands, they greatly enhance the beauty and color of American culture. Their faith, determination, and hard work and their devotion to family life inspire men and women throughout the United States. 
The celebration of Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week provides a welcome opportunity to acknowledge the many contributions that Asian and Pacific Americans have made to American society and to express our appreciation for them. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 7, 1989, as Asian/Pacific American Heritage Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
