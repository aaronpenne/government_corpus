A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 patriotic Americans, with pioneer endeavor and heroic endurance, created a basis for self-government in a fertile territory of the Northwest; and
Whereas
 Oregon, on February 14, 1859, in recognition of the achievements of its people, was admitted into the Union as the thirty-third State of the United States; and
Whereas
 the year 1959 will mark the one hundredth anniversary of statehood for Oregon, known as the Beaver State, and the Legislative Assembly of that State has provided for a Centennial Celebration to commemorate the anniversary in a fitting and a proper manner; and
Whereas
 this Celebration, which will include the Oregon Centennial Exposition and International Trade Fair, will bring to the attention of the Nation and the world the resources of the Northwest, will stimulate industry, will promote trade and peaceful relationships with other peoples, and will serve as a reminder of the rich and historic heritage of the land at the end of the Oregon Trail; and

I also invite the States of the Union, and our Territories and possessions to participate in the Celebration which will be held at Portland, Oregon, in 1959.
