A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the progress made against cancer during the past quarter of a century offers definite hope that the burden of this disease will one day be lifted from mankind; and 
Whereas
 this hope can be realized only through continued biomedical research and energetic health programs in this country and the world over; and 
Whereas
 the National Cancer Institute and the American Cancer Society are joining in observing 1962 as Cancer Progress Year to mark the twenty-fifth anniversary of the National Cancer Institute Act and the first nationwide educational program instituted by the American Cancer Society; and 
Whereas
 such observance will give encouragement to scientists in their research and to the medical and health professions in their efforts to control cancer with the cooperation of an alert and informed public; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April as Cancer Control Month: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1962 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
I also ask the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all interested persons and groups to unite within the appointed month, and throughout Cancer Progress Year, in public reaffirmation of this Nation's effort to control cancer. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
