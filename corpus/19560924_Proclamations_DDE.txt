A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 a grateful Nation has enshrined in its heart the memory of those selfless men who came from across the seas and aided in the achievement of our independence during the Revolutionary War; and
Whereas
 October 11, 1956, marks the one hundred and seventy-seventh anniversary of the death of Count Casimir Pulaski, one of those heroes who left his homeland to fight in our cause, and who for that cause laid down his life; and
Whereas
 the story of his valiant assault upon the city of Savannah at the head of the Pulaski Legion, where he received a mortal wound, has long stirred the imagination and evoked the admiration of all who hold liberty dear; and
Whereas
 this distinguished Pole, who had achieved the rank of Brigadier General before his untimely death at the age of 31 years, left to posterity an inspiring example of fidelity to principle which we should cherish and emulate:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of this Nation to observe Thursday, the eleventh day of October, 1956, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day with suitable commemorative ceremonies; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day as a mark of respect to the memory of General Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 24th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
