A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 July 5, 1965, marks the one-hundredth anniversary of the establishment of the United States Secret Service; and 
Whereas
 for a century the United States Secret Service has stood as guardian of the integrity of the securities and money of the United States; and 
Whereas
 for nearly two-thirds of a century the United States Secret Service has borne the responsibility for protecting the Chief Executives of our Nation; and 
Whereas
 the responsibilities entrusted to the small and dedicated force of the Secret Service are today of greatest importance to the orderly functioning of our system of government: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of July 5 through July 11, 1965, as United States Secret Service Week; and I urge communities, civic organizations, and all citizens to participate in appropriate commemoration of the contributions which the Secret Service has made during its existence, and, especially, I ask that the appreciation of the Nation be extended to the men of the Secret Service, and to their families, for the spirit and standards of selfless service which have won the esteem and respect of the Nation during the century of the Service's discharge of the high duty assigned to it. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

DEAN RUSK,
