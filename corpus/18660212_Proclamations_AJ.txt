Andrew Johnson, President of the United States of America
 
To all whom it may concern:
 
An exequatur, bearing date the 13th day of October, 1864, having been issued to Esteban Rogers, recognizing him as consul
 ad interim
 of the Republic of Chile for the port of New York and its dependencies and declaring him free to exercise and enjoy such functions, powers, and privileges as are allowed to consuls by the law of nations or by the laws of the United States and existing treaty stipulations between the Government of Chile and the United States; but as it is deemed advisable that the said Esteban Rogers should no longer be permitted to continue in the exercise of said functions, powers, and privileges:
These are therefore to declare that I no longer recognize the said Esteban Rogers as consul
 ad interim
 of the Republic of Chile for the port of New York and its dependencies and will not permit him to exercise or enjoy any of the functions, powers, or privileges allowed to a consular officer of that nation; and that I do hereby wholly revoke and annul the said exequatur heretofore given and do declare the same to be absolutely null and void from this day forward.
In testimony whereof I have caused these letters to be made patent and the seal of the United States of America to be hereunto affixed.
Given under my hand, at Washington, this 12th day of February, A. D. 1866, and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninetieth.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
By the President:
WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
 Secretary of State.
