A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 during the past year preventable fires have taken thousands of lives; and
Whereas
 destruction of property by fire results in an annual loss of nearly a billion dollars, of an untold number of jobs, and of an irreplaceable amount of production; and
Whereas
 safety of life and property and conservation of natural resources are of primary importance to every citizen of the Nation; and
Whereas
 the effectiveness of sound fire prevention programs has been demonstrated in communities throughout the land:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 3, 1954, as Fire Prevention Week.
I call upon all citizens to initiate a year-round campaign against the waste caused by preventable fires, and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the National Fire Waste Council, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies, to cooperate in the observance of Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national campaign against the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this Fourth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
