ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE
General Otis,
 Manila, Philippine Islands:
 
By direction of the Secretary of War, following from the President is sent you for your early consideration. CORBIN.
The President desires that Admiral Dewey and General Otis shall have an early conference and advise him what force and equipment will be necessary in the Philippine Islands. The President would be glad to have suggestions from these commanders as to the government of the islands, which of necessity must be by the Army and the Navy for some time to come. When these islands shall be ceded to us, it is his desire that peace and tranquillity shall be restored and as kind and beneficent a government as possible given to the people, that they may be encouraged in their industries and made secure in life and property. The fullest suggestions are invited.
WILLIAM McKINLEY.
