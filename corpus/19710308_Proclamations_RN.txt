A Proclamation
 
From the beginning of our country, Americans have worked together voluntarily to help master common needs and problems. This year marks the seventy-fifth anniversary of one of the Nation's leading voluntary action organizations, the Volunteers of America, devoted to solving the spiritual and social problems of our needy.
In recognition of the work of this humanitarian organization, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 337, has requested the President to designate the second week of March 1971 as Volunteers of America Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of March 7, 1971, as Volunteers of America Week. I urge our people during that week to express their appreciation and gratitude for the untiring and selfless work of the Volunteers of America and to continue their support of its activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
