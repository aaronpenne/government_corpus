A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 since the founding of our Nation, our citizens have zealously worked and sacrificed to provide schools and colleges for the education of our children, our youths, and our adults; and
Whereas
 the White House Conference on Education held in 1955, with delegates from all the States and Territories, representing millions of citizens of all races, faiths, and walks of life, re-emphasized the needs of the Nation for more and better schools and colleges to the end that our people through improved education may make a greater contribution to the progress and future welfare of America, and to the peace and well-being of the world; and
Whereas
 the setting aside of a special education week each year provides a fitting opportunity for parents and educators and the public generally to visit schools and educational institutions, to express their appreciation of the work of our teachers and school officials, and to exchange views upon educational problems and progress:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 11 to November 17, 1956, as American Education Week; and I urge the fullest possible participation in the observance of that week by the people throughout the United States. This week of dedication to education and to the efforts and achievements of teachers, school and college administrators, and others in this important area of public service is especially significant during this first year of appraisal, in terms of local community needs and required action, of the recommendations made by the White House Conference on Education. Let us all stress the need for good schools to keep America strong.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
