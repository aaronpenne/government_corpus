By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including Section 301 of Title 3 of the United States Code, and in order to delegate certain functions concerning the promotion of commissioned officers of the Naval Reserve and the Marine Corps Reserve, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. The function vested in the President by Section 5898(b) of Title 10 of the United States Code to approve, modify, or disapprove the report of a Naval Reserve or Marine Corps Reserve selection board is delegated to the Secretary of Defense.

Sec. 2. The function delegated to the Secretary of Defense by this Order may be redelegated to the Deputy Secretary of Defense, any of the Assistant Secretaries of Defense, and the Secretary of the Navy who may further subdelegate such authority to subordinates who are appointed to their office by the President, by and with the advice and consent of the Senate. 
Sec. 3. With respect to the functions delegated by this Order, all prior actions taken for or on behalf of the President that would have been valid if taken pursuant to this Order are ratified.
