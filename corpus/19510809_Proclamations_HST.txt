A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 during the past year preventable fires have again brought death to at least ten thousand of our citizens and permanent disability or painful injury to scores of thousands more; and
Whereas
 each year natural and created resources worth nearly a billion dollars are destroyed in our country by fire; and
Whereas
 the present emergency especially requires that we conserve our manpower, our productive facilities, and our material resources:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 7, 1951, as Fire Prevention Week.
I urge that every man, woman, and child in this great land contribute to the national effort to make the United States strong by accepting individual responsibility in the year-round campaign against the needless waste of life and destruction of property by preventable fires. I request that State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the national Fire Waste Council, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, business, labor, and farm organizations, churches, schools, civic groups, and the agencies of public information, including newspapers, magazines, and the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, cooperate fully in the observance of Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this crusade against the toll of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 9th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
