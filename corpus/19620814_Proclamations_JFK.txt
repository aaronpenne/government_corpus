By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Natural Bridges National Monument, Utah, established by Proclamation No. 804 of April 16, 1903, and modified by Proclamation No. 881 of September 25, 1909, and Proclamation No. 1323 of February 11, 1916, was reserved and set apart for the preservation and protection of three extraordinary natural bridges and certain surrounding prehistoric ruins and cave springs; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to add to such monument approximately five thousand two hundred and thirty-six acres of land near the present boundaries which contain additional cliff-type prehistoric Indian ruins and suitable space for construction of a visitor center, administrative offices, employee residences, utility and maintenance facilities, and a new entrance road; and 
Whereas
 it also appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude from the monument approximately three hundred and twenty acres of land, known as Snow Flat Spring Cave and Cigarette Spring Cave, which no longer contain features of archeological value and are not needed for the proper care, management, protection, interpretation, and preservation of the monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
