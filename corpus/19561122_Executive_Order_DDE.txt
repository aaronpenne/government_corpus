WHEREAS there exist certain labor disputes between employers (or associations by which such employers are represented in collective bargaining conferences) who are (1) steamship companies or who are engaged as operators or agents for ships engaged in service from or to Atlantic and Gulf Coast ports from Portland, Maine, to Brownsville, Texas, or from or to other ports of the United States or its Territories or possessions, (2) contracting stevedores, (3) contracting marine carpenters, or (4) other employers engaged in related or associated pier activities, and certain of their employees represented by the International Longshoremen's Association (Independent); and
WHEREAS in my opinion such disputes have resulted in a strike affecting a substantial part of the maritime industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States and with foreign nations, which strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national health and safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947 (61 Stat. 155, 29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of Thomas W. Holland, Chairman, Arthur Stark and Jacob J. Blair, to inquire into the issues involved in such disputes.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of the said act on or before November 24, 1956.
Upon the submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
