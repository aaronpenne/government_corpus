A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the founding of the United nations has given the people of the world an organization through which nations may resolve their differences without resort to war and has made possible greater international cooperation in the economic, political, and cultural fields; and
Whereas
 the United Nations continues to be the only existing international organ which offers mankind a hope for ultimate world peace; and
Whereas
 the realization by citizens of other nations that the overwhelming majority of Americans support the United Nations and its great purposes would help to speed the day when there will in fact be peace on earth, good will toward men; and
Whereas
 the General Assembly of the United Nations has declared that October 24, the anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Charter, shall be dedicated each year to the dissemination of information concerning the aims and accomplishments of the United Nations:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the citizens of this Nation to observe Friday, October 24, 1952, as United Nations Day by sending greetings to friends, relatives, and associates in other countries which are members of the United Nations, and by expressing their confidence in the United Nations, their friendship for other peoples, and their faith in the ultimate demonstration throughout the world of the brotherhood of man.
I also call upon the officials of the Federal, State, and local Governments, the National Citizens' Committee for United Nations Day, representatives of civic, educational, and religious organizations, agencies of the press, radio, television, motion pictures, and other communications media, and all citizens to cooperate in appropriate observance of this day throughout our country.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 17th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
