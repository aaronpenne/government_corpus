A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the world has entered a new decade of increasing international development which promises to surpass all prior periods in economic progress and prosperity; and
Whereas
 this development creates an opportunity for our Nation and our friends abroad to share the mutual benefits from expanding world trade; and
Whereas
 expanded United States exports are essential to our healthy economic growth, add substantially to the millions of jobs already generated for our people by export trade, and contribute significantly to our capacity to sustain our international investment, travel, and trade; and
Whereas
 the Government has inaugurated a national Export Expansion Program to increase the sale of United States products abroad and to improve the capacity of American business for international competition through the full application of the dynamic forces of our free-enterprise system:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 15, 1960, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate Federal, State, and local officials to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to emphasize the importance of world trade to our economy and to our relations with other nations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
