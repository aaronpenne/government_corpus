A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American flag is emblematic of a Nation indivisible, though its people are of diverse ethnic strains, races, and religions; and 
Whereas
 our flag symbolizes the ideals of freedom, justice, and brotherhood, which are deeply rooted in our political and spiritual traditions and which have helped our country to become a land of progress and a rampart of liberty; and 
Whereas
 in combat our flag has always been a guide and inspiration to our armed forces, who have given valiant expression to man's eternal striving for freedom; and 
Whereas
 these times call for renewed vitality, moral fervor, and intellectual understanding to safeguard the ideals and principles which our flag represents; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day, in commemoration of the adoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Wednesday, June 14, 1961; and I call upon the people to observe that day with suitable ceremonies, including the display of the flag at their homes and other appropriate places. 
I also urge our citizens to pause during this day and resolve always to sustain the allegiance of our hearts and minds toward our national banner and to cultivate the dynamic principles and ideals that it symbolizes. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this thirtieth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
