By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States and Canada on January 16, 1965, entered into an Agreement Concerning Automotive Products, which provides that Canada shall accord duty-free treatment to imports of certain automotive products of the United States and that, after enactment of implementing legislation, the United States shall accord duty-free treatment to certain automotive products of Canada retroactively to the earliest date administratively possible following the date on which the agreement has been implemented by Canada (art. II, 89th Cong., 1st sess., H. Rep. 537, 38) ;
Whereas
 the agreement of January 16, 1965, was implemented by Canada through the granting of the requisite duty-free treatment to United States products on January 18, 1965;
Whereas
 titles II and IV of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 have been enacted to provide for modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) to implement the agreement of January 16, 1965, such modifications to enter into force in the manner proclaimed by the President (79 Stat.) ;
Whereas
 sections 201 (a) and 203 of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965 authorize the President to proclaim the modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States provided for in sections 403, 404, and 405 of that Act with retroactive effect as of the earliest date after January 17, 1965, which he determines to be practicable, and section 401 (b) of that Act provides that the rates of duty in column numbered 1 of the tariff schedules that are modified pursuant to such proclamation shall be treated as having been proclaimed by the President as being required to carry out a foreign trade agreement to which the United States is a party (79 Stat.); and
Whereas
 I determine that the earliest date, after January 17, 1965, as of which it is practicable to give retroactive effect to this proclamation is January 18, 1965:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, particularly sections 201(a) and 203 of the Automotive Products Trade Act of 1965, do proclaim (1) that the modifications of the Tariff Schedules of the United States provided for in sections 403 and 404 of that Act shall enter into force on the day following the date of this proclamation, and (2) that the modifications of the tariff schedules provided for in section 405 of that Act shall enter into force on December 20, 1965, effective with respect to articles which are or have been entered for consumption, or for warehouse, on or after January 18, 1965.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
