By virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155 (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby amend the title of Executive Order No. 11025 of June 7, 1962, to read as follows: "Creating a Board of Inquiry to Report on Labor Disputes Affecting the Tactical Fighter Production Industry, which is part of the Aircraft Industry of the United States." 
By virtue of the above stated authority I further amend Executive Order No. 11025 by substituting the following for the first and second paragraphs: 
"WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between Republic Aviation Corporation, Farmingdale, Long Island, New York, and certain of its employees represented by the International Association of Machinists; Republic Lodge 1987, International Association of Machinists, AFL-CIO; Local Union 775, United Association of Journeymen and Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the United States and Canada, AFL-CIO; International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local Union 25, AFL-CIO; Local Union 1318, United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, AFL-CIO; and International Union of Operating Engineers, Local Unions 30 and 30-A, AFL-CIO; and between John G.
