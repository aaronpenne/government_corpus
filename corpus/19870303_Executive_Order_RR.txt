By the authority vested in me as President by the laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5 of the United States Code, and in order to expand the eligibility of certain former overseas employees for noncompetitive appointment in the competitive service, it is hereby ordered as follows:

(a) by inserting after "employee" the following: ", a nonappropriated fund employee,"; 
(b) by striking out "24" and inserting in lieu thereof "18"; and 
(c) by adding at the end thereof the following new sentence: "The employing agency in the United States may waive a requirement for a written test for an individual appointed under this Order if the agency determines that the duties and responsibilities of the position occupied overseas were similar enough to those of the position to which the individual is being appointed under this Order to make the written test unnecessary.".
