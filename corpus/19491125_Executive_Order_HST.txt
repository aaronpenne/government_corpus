By virtue of THE AUTHORITY VESTED IN ME BY SECTION 1 OF THE International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the South Pacific Commission under the authority of the act of January 28, 1948, 62 Stat. 15, I hereby designate such Commission as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the said International Organizations Immunities Act.
The designation of the South Pacific Commission as a public international organization within the meaning of the said International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which such organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.
