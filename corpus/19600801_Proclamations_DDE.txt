A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American system of free public education, recognizing the supreme importance of the individual and his right to develop his capacities to the full, has created a virile and powerful society of responsible citizens; and
Whereas
 this educational system is a means for preserving the most precious heritage of our land and a basic requirement for further social and economic advances; and
Whereas
, through the benefits of education, the peoples of the world have entered a new age which can open up an intensified attack on the ancient ills of poverty, disease, and ignorance and which can harness the energies of mankind for a better way of life for all; and 
Whereas
 it is imperative that we continue to lead in this age by building on the accomplishments of the past so that our educational system will adequately prepare our children for the responsibilities of the future:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 6 through November 12, 1960, as American Education Week; and I urge citizens throughout the Nation to participate actively the observance of that week in their schools and communities.
Let us reaffirm our deep interest in the training ground of democracy. Let us study the programs of our schools and demonstrate our support for the work of our dedicated teachers. Let us take every opportunity to strengthen our educational system so that our young people can be prepared to meet the challenge imposed on our Nation by this competitive century.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this first day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
