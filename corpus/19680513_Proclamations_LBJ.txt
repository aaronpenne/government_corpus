By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
This year will mark the 200th anniversary of the establishment of the City of Charlotte, in Mecklenburg County, North Carolina.
As one of the original thirteen colonies, North Carolina—and particularly the people of Mecklenburg County—played an important role in our early struggle for freedom.
The historical background and dynamic growth of Charlotte are typical of our Nation. It is fitting, therefore, that recognition be given to the bicentennial anniversary of Charlotte—the Queen City. To this end, the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 13, 1968, has designated May 20, 1968, as Charlotte, North Carolina, Day, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the appropriate observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite the people of the United States to observe Charlotte, North Carolina, Day, May 20, 1968, with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
