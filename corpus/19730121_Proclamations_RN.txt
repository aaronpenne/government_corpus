By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Jaycee idea began with a handful of young men in St. Louis 53 years ago. Today, it embraces some 325,000 members in the more than 6,000 American communities, that have chapters of the United States Jaycees, and it enriches the lives of communities in 80 countries around the world through the affiliates of Junior Chamber International.
Yet even in its maturity the Jaycees organization retains a youthful outlook, and even with its global scope it continues to build on the individual member—first helping him be the best man he can be, then helping him help his fellow man in need, one to one.
The Jaycee cares about people, and he shows it. He cares about progress, and he does something about it. He lives by the creed that "Service to humanity is the best work of life," and he throws himself into that work both as a vocation and as an avocation.
He is the kind of young man this country will need in great numbers to help meet the challenges of our Bicentennial Era and our coming third century. It is fitting that we should annually give special recognition and encouragement to him and to his organization.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 21, 1973, as National Jaycee Week—a time for the expression of America's gratitude for the many significant contributions of the U.S. Jaycees.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
