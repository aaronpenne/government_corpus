WHEREAS Sections 401 and 403 of Title IV of Part II of the Legislative Appropriation Act, fiscal year 1933, as amended by an act of Congress approved March 3, 1933, provide:
"Sec. 401. The Congress hereby declares that a serious emergency exists by reason of the general economic depression; that it is imperative to reduce drastically governmental expenditures; and that such reduction may be accomplished in great measure by proceeding immediately under the provisions of this title.
"Accordingly, the President shall investigate the present organization of all executive and administrative agencies of the Government and shall determine what changes therein are necessary to accomplish the following purposes:
"(a) To reduce expenditures to the fullest extent consistent with the efficient operation of the Government;
"(b) To increase the efficiency of the operations of the Government to the fullest extent practicable within the revenues;
"(c) To group, coordinate, and consolidate executive and administrative agencies of the Government, as nearly as may be, according to major purposes;
"(d) To reduce the number of such agencies by consolidating those having similar functions under a single head, and by abolishing such agencies and/or such functions thereof as may not be necessary for the efficient conduct of the Government; "(e) To eliminate overlapping and duplication of effort; and
"(f) To segregate regulatory agencies and functions from those of an administrative and executive character.
"Sec. 403. Whenever the President, after investigation, shall find and declare that any regrouping, consolidation, transfer, or abolition of any executive agency or agencies and/or the functions thereof is necessary to accomplish any of the purposes set forth in section 401 of this title, he may by Executive orderâ€”
"(a) Transfer the whole or any part of any executive agency and/or the functions thereof to the jurisdiction and control of any other executive agency;
"(b) Consolidate the functions vested in any executive agency; or
"(c) Abolish the whole or any part of any executive agency and/or the functions thereof; and
"(d) Designate and fix the name and functions of any consolidated activity or executive agency and the title, powers, and duties of its executive head; except that the President shall not have authority under this title to abolish or transfer an executive department and/or all the functions thereof."
NOW, THEREFORE, pursuant to the authority so vested in me, and after investigation, it is found and declared that the following changes in executive agencies and the functions thereof are necessary to accomplish the purposes set forth in section 401 above recited, and it is hereby ordered that:
