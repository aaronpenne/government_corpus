By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The cause of human rights and personal dignity remains a universal aspiration. Yet, in much of the world, the struggle for freedom and independence continues. It is appropriate, therefore, that we who value our own precious heritage should manifest our sympathy and understanding for those to whom these benefits are denied. The Eighty-Sixth Congress on July 17, 1959, by a joint resolution, authorized and requested the President to proclaim the third week of July in each year as Captive Nations Week in support of this sentiment.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 16, 1972, as Captive Nations Week.
I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to give renewed devotion to the just aspirations of all peoples for self-determination and human liberty.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
