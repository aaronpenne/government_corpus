By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Each year we set aside a special day to thank America's veterans for their unselfish sacrifice and service. 
On Veterans Day, 1980, we pay tribute to 30 million living and 14 million deceased patriots who served in our Armed Forces so that you and I might live in freedom. We must honor these men and women as they deserve, not only with special ceremonies, not only through our support of veterans' benefits and services, but also by committing ourselves anew to the task of ensuring that the freedoms they helped to preserve and the Nation they fought to defend will be safe and secure for future generations of Americans. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite every citizen of our great country to join with me in observing Veterans Day on Tuesday, November 11, 1980, with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
I call upon all Americans to support the Veterans Day theme?"A Grateful Nation Remembers"?and I urge families, friends, neighbors and fellow citizens to show their gratitude by visiting ill and disabled veterans in Veterans Administration medical centers across the country. 
I ask that Federal, State, and local government officials arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on this special day the flag under which our veterans served with honor, pride, and distinction. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the two hundred and fifth.
JIMMY CARTER
