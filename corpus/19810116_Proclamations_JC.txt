By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. On October 31, 1979, under the authority of section 101 (a) (1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.G. 2111(a) (1)), the United States entered into a trade agreement with the United Mexican States (Mexico) containing certain tariff concessions by the United States. These tariff concessions were implemented by Proclamation No. 4707 of December 11, 1979, beginning January 1, 1980. This agreement provides that, under certain circumstances which now exist, the United States may suspend or withdraw these concessions in whole or in part. 
2. An expectation, which this agreement stated to be the basis for the United States concessions therein, not having materialized, and only partially equivalent substitute concessions having been received from Mexico, the President, by Proclamation 4792 of September 15, 1980 (45 Fed. Reg. 61589), suspended in part tariff concessions which were granted to Mexico in the October 31, 1979 agreement because adequate substitute compensatory concessions had not been provided by Mexico at that time. 
3. In view of the temporary modification of the rate of duty on unwrought lead other than lead bullion by section 114 of Public Law 96-609, of December 28, 1980, and of the extent of concessions which have been received from Mexico, I determine that the suspension of the concessions under the Agreement of October 31, 1979 should be modified as set forth below. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including sections 125 and 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2135 and 2483), do proclaim that: 
The tariff concessions proclaimed by Proclamation No. 4707 on litharge and red lead provided for in items 473.52 and 473.56 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202), (in the case of litharge as partially suspended by Proclamation 4792) are suspended as set forth in the Annex of this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
