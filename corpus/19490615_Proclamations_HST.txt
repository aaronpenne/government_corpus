A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Gifford Pinchot, the first Chief of the Forest Service, who served in the Department of Agriculture from 1898 to 1910, was primarily responsible for the establishment of our national-forest system; and
Whereas
 he established many of the basic policies which guide our national-forest administration today; and
Whereas
 he has long been recognized as the foremost forester and forest conservationist of this Nation; and
Whereas
 his life was spent almost wholly in the service of the public; and
Whereas
 it is especially appropriate to pay tribute to Gifford Pinchot by naming one of our great national forests in his honor:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of June 4, 1897, 30 Stat. 11, 36 (16 U.S.C. 473), do hereby proclaim that the Columbia National Forest in the State of Washington, as defined by Executive Order No. 820 of June 18, 1908, and as subsequently modified by Executive orders and acts of Congress, is hereby designated and hereafter shall be known as the Gifford Pinchot National Forest.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 15th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
