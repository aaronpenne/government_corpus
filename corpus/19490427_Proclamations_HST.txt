A Proclamation
Whereas
 our loftiest national ideals stem in large measure from those high principles which American mothers teach by example and devotion in their daily lives; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), formalized the happy custom of commemorating motherhood on the second Sunday in May of each year; and
Whereas
 in accordance with the dictates of our hearts we have set that day aside for manifestations of our love and reverence for all mothers of the land:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request the observance of Sunday, May 8, 1949, as Mother's Day, and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day. I also call upon the people of the Nation to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on Mother's Day, 1949, as a public demonstration of the esteem in which we hold our mothers, and I urge that renewed expressions of affection be tendered mothers on that day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 27th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
