By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The heritage of the Jewish people finds expression in America today just as in the days of our Founders. During Jewish Heritage Week, we recall that throughout our history the American people have drawn inspiration from and analogies to Jewish history. That history—which in this century alone includes the horrors of the Holocaust, the establishment of the modern State of Israel, and the current struggle of Soviet Jewry for freedom—symbolizes humanity's long and continuing quest for liberty. 
Happily, the United States, the land of the free, has become home to a thriving Jewish community whose members have made inestimable contributions to our national life. Jews have distinguished themselves in virtually every field, to the benefit of us all. Jewish Heritage Week, which this year includes April 21, the 40th anniversary of the founding of Israel, is a fitting occasion for us to study once again the lessons of Jewish history and to rededicate ourselves to the ideals of freedom for all peoples. 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 527, has designated the period of April 17 through April 24, 1988, as "Jewish Heritage Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of April 17 through April 24, 1988, as Jewish Heritage Week. I call upon the people of the United States, interested organizations, and Federal, State, and local government officials to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
