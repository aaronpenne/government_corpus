Whereas the Congress of the United States has declared the existence of an acute national economic emergency which affects the national public interest and welfare, and
Whereas, in order to meet the said emergency and to provide the relief necessary to protect the general welfare of the people, the Congress of the United States has enacted legislation including, among other statutes, the National Industrial Recovery Act of June 16, 1933 (Public No. 67, 73d Congress), the Agricultural Adjustment Act of May 12, 1933 (Public No. 10, 73d Congress) and the Federal Emergency Relief Act of May 12, 1933 (Public No. 15, 73d Congress); and
Whereas it is deemed expedient and necessary that an organization be created for the purpose of coordinating and making more efficient and productive the work of the numerous field agencies of the Government established under, and for the purpose of carrying into, effect, the provisions of the said legislation;
Now, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid legislation, there is hereby created an organization which shall be known as the National Emergency Council, at the head of which shall be an Executive Director who shall be appointed by the President and shall receive a salary to be fixed by him at not to exceed $10,000.00 per annum. The Council shall be composed of the following and such other members as the President may designate:

 The Secretary of Commerce
 The Secretary of Labor
 The Administrator of Agricultural Adjustment
 The Administrator of Federal Emergency Relief
 The Administrator for Industrial Recovery
 The Chairman of the Home Owners Loan Corporation
 The Governor of the Farm Credit Administration
 A representative of the Consumers' Council
The members of the Council shall act in a capacity advisory to the President and the Executive Director and shall serve without compensation.
The functions and duties of the Council shall be prescribed by the President, and such rules and regulations as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes for which the Council is created shall be prescribed by the Executive Director and approved by the President.
The Executive Director is authorized to execute the functions and to perform the duties vested in the Council by the President through such persons as the Executive Director shall designate, and he is further authorized to prescribe such rules and regulations as he may deem necessary to supplement, amplify or carry out the purposes and intent of such rules and regulations as may be prescribed by him and approved by the President under the provisions of this Order.
The Executive Director may appoint, subject to the approval of the President, without regard to the Civil Service laws or the Classification Act of 1923, as amended, fix the compensation and prescribe the duties and authority of such officials and employees, and make such expenditures (including expenditures for personal services, and rent at the seat of the Government and elsewhere, for law books and books of reference, and for paper, binding, and printing) as may be necessary to carry into effect the provisions of this Order. The Executive Director may also, with the consent of any board, commission, independent establishment, or executive department of the Government, including any field service thereof, avail himself of the services of the officials, employees, and the facilities thereof and, with the consent of the State or municipality concerned, may utilize such State and local officials and employees as he may deem necessary.
For the purposes of this Order, the sum of $10,000 is hereby allocated to the National Emergency Council from the appropriation authorized by Section 220 of the National Recovery Act and made by the Fourth Deficiency Act, fiscal year 1933, approved June 16, 1933 (Public No. 77, 73d Congress).
All volunteer field agencies established under, and for the purpose of effectuating, the provisions of the aforesaid legislation, are hereby abolished, this provision to become effective thirty days from the date of this Order; and thereafter all functions theretofore performed by said agencies and considered necessary by the Executive Director for carrying out the purposes of this Order shall be assumed and performed by the Council.
