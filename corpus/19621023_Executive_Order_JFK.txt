By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Joint Resolution of October 3, 1962 (Public Law 87-736), and by section 301 of title 3 of the United States Code, and as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
SECTION 1. The Secretary of Defense, and, when designated by him for this purpose, any of the Secretaries of the military departments of the Department of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the Coast Guard are hereby authorized and empowered to exercise the authority vested in the President until February 28, 1963, by section 1 of the Act of October 3, 1962 (Public Law 87-736) to order, without the consent of the persons concerned, any unit, or any member, of the Ready Reserve of an armed force to active duty for not more than twelve consecutive months, provided there are not more than 150,000 members of the Ready Reserve thereby on active duty (other than for training) without their consent at any one time. 
SEC. 2. In pursuance of the provisions of section 2 of the said Joint Resolution of October 3, 1962, the Secretary of Defense and the Secretary of the Treasury with respect to the Coast Guard are hereby authorized to extend enlistments, appointments, periods of active duty, periods of active duty for training, periods of obligated service or other military status in any component of an armed force or in the National Guard that expire before February 28, 1963, for not more than twelve months. However, if the enlistment of a member of the Ready Reserve who is ordered to active duty under section 1 of this Executive Order would expire after February 28, 1963, but before he has served the entire period for which he was so ordered to active duty, his enlistment may be extended until the last day of that period. 
SEC. 3. In pursuance of the provisions of section 3 of the said Joint Resolution of October 3, 1962, no member of the armed forces who was involuntarily ordered to active duty or whose period of active duty was extended under the Act of August 1, 1961, Public Law 87-117 (75 Stat. 242), may be involuntarily ordered to active duty under this Executive Order.
