By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and section 1753 of the Revised Statutes, and as President of the United States, it is ordered that paragraph 3(a) of Executive Order No. 9721 of May 10, 1946, providing for the transfer of personnel to public international organizations in which the United States Government participates be, and it is hereby modified as follows:
The provision which requires that service in the public international organization to which the employee is transferred shall be terminated within three years from the date of such transfer to entitle the employee to the reemployment rights conferred by the said paragraph is modified so that Paul D. Miles shall, upon transfer in accordance with the said Executive order from the Federal Communications Commission to the International Frequency Registration Board of the International Telecommunication Union, be entitled to such reemployment rights if his service with the said International Frequency Registration Board is terminated without prejudice within five years from the date of his transfer to such Board; provided that he complies with all other provisions of the said Executive order with respect to such reemployment.
This order shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER.
