WHEREAS, a dispute exists between the Long Island Rail Road and certain of its employees represented by the Brotherhood of Railroad Trainmen, a labor organization; and
WHEREAS, this dispute has not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and
WHEREAS, this dispute, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threatens substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service:
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a Board of three members to be appointed by me to investigate this dispute. No member of the Board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad members or any carriers.
The Board shall report its findings to the President with respect to the dispute within 30 days from the date of this order.
As provided by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for 30 days after the Board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the Long Island Rail Road, or by its employees, in the conditions out of which the dispute arose.
