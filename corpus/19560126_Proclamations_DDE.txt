A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 initiative, a sense of individual dignity, and the determination to mold one's own future are important elements of the character of the youth of our country; and
Whereas
 many of our young people are learning American business methods by actually organizing and operating their own enterprises under the guidance of businessmen of their local communities; and
Whereas
 the experience in business management gained through participation in these small enterprises is of immense value in stimulating the spirit of achievement, independence, and community responsibility in our youth; and
Whereas
 thousands of American businessmen voluntarily give unstintingly of their time, their counsel, and their experience for the benefit of these junior achievers; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by Senate Concurrent Resolution 59, agreed to January 17, 1956, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning January 29, 1956, as National Junior Achievement Week:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 29, 1956, and ending February 4, 1956, as National Junior Achievement Week; and I urge all citizens of our country to salute the activities of Junior Achievers and their volunteer adult advisers through appropriate ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
