By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On October 13, we honor the great Italian navigator whose historic westward voyage blazed the way for the settlers from many lands who followed to build a new world. 
Our admiration for the achievement of Christopher Columbus has not dimmed over the span of nearly five centuries. Sailing in the service of the Spanish Crown, whose vision and support made his journey possible, Columbus pursued his dream in the face of enormous challenges with an unshakable courage and faith that set an example for future generations of Americans. 
We can all take great pride, as we look forward to our Bicentennial celebrations, in honoring the memory of the epic accomplishments of Christopher Columbus which led to the development of the Americas and the founding of this great Nation. 
In tribute to the achievement of Columbus, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved April 30, 1934 (48 Stat. 657, 36 U.S.C. 146), as modified by the Act of June 28, 1968 (82 Stat. 250, 5 U.S.C. 6103 (a) and note), requested the President to proclaim the second Monday in October of each year as Columbus Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, October 13, 1975, as Columbus Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe that day in schools, churches, and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the great explorer. 
I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all public buildings on the appointed day in memory of Christopher Columbus. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundredth. 
GERALD R. FORD
