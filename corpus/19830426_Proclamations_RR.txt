By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Regular, vigorous physical activity is essential to good health and effective performance of our daily responsibilities. In addition, physical activity and sports programs can provide rich sources of personal pleasure and satisfaction. 
Many individuals, families, communities, and others are increasingly concerned about physical fitness, and there is a growing recognition that physical activity is an important part of daily life for people of both sexes and all ages. Americans who are not reaping the benefits and pleasures of physical activity and sports should develop a personal physical fitness program in accordance with their capability. 
In recognition of the importance of physical activity as a part of our daily life, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 53, has authorized and requested the President to designate the month of May 1983 as "National Physical Fitness and Sports Month." 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of May 1983 as National Physical Fitness and Sports Month and urge communities, schools, States, employers, voluntary organizations, churches, and other organizations to stage appropriate observances and special events. Furthermore, I urge individuals and families to use this occasion to renew their commitments to make regular physical activity an integral part of their lives. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 26th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
