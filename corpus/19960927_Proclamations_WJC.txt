By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United States has had in effect a bilateral Agreement on Trade Relations with Bulgaria since 1991, which was last renewed for an additional 3-year term in 1994. Pursuant to my authority under subsection 405(b)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2435(b)(1)), I reconfirm that a satisfactory balance of concessions in trade and services has been maintained during the life of the Agreement and that actual or foreseeable reductions in U.S. tariffs and nontariff barriers to trade resulting from multilateral negotiations are, and continuously have been, satisfactorily reciprocated by Bulgaria.
Moreover, pursuant to section 2 of Public Law 104-162, and having due regard for the findings of the Congress in section 1 of said Law, I hereby determine that title IV of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2431-2441) should no longer apply to Bulgaria.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including but not limited to section 2 of Public Law 104-162, do proclaim that:
(1) Nondiscriminatory treatment (most-favored-nation treatment) shall be extended to the products of Bulgaria, which will no longer be subject to title IV of the Trade Act of 1974.
(2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and Executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency.
(3) The extension of nondiscriminatory treatment to the products of Bulgaria shall be effective as of the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twenty-first.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
