By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Friday, July 9, 1982 has been designated as "National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day, 1982." It is a fitting mark of recognition of the uncommon sacrifices of all former American prisoners of war, those still missing, and their families, that a P.O.W.-M.I.A. flag fly over the White House and the Pentagon. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution as President and Commander in Chief of the armed forces, do hereby proclaim that a P.O.W.-M.I.A. flag shall be flown, subordinate to the National Colors, over the White House and the Pentagon on National P.O.W.-M.I.A. Recognition Day, Friday, July 9, 1982. 
I invite other government officials and individuals to join in this special mark of recognition and to participate in appropriate observances. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh. 
RONALD REAGAN
