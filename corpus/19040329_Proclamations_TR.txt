A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 in the opening of the Kiowa, Comanche, Apache, and Wichita Indian lands in the Territory of Oklahoma, by proclamation dated July 4, 1901, pursuant to section six of the act of Congress approved June 6, 1900 (31 Stat., 672, 676), the north half of the northwest quarter and the southwest quarter of the northwest quarter of section thirty-two in township two north, of range eleven west of the Indian principal meridian, containing one hundred and twenty acres, was reserved for the use of the Fort Sill Indian boarding school of Kiowa agency; 
And Whereas,
 it appears that said land is no longer required for use by said school, and that it adjoins the City of Lawton, Oklahoma Territory, and the city authorities of said city desire to make entry thereof for park purposes under the act of Congress approved September 30, 1890 (26 Stat., 502); 
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section six of said act of Congress of June 6, 1900, do hereby declare and make known that said land is hereby restored to the public domain, to be disposed of to said city, for park purposes under said act of Congress approved September 30, 1890. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and four, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-eighth.
