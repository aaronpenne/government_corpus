By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 I approved on March 2, 1917, a Joint Resolution of the Congress of the United States of America, reading as follows: 
"Whereas in the countries situated in the eastern part of Europe, the theatre of devastating war, there are at least one million of Ruthenians (Ukrainians) in dire need of food, clothing, and shelter; and 
"Whereas hundreds of thousands of these people have been forced to abandon their homes and their property, and being deprived of all opportunity to provide even for their most elementary wants have undergone disease, starvation, and indescribable suffering; and 
"Whereas the people of the United States of America have learned with sorrow of this terrible plight of great numbers of their fellow beings and have most generously responded to the appeal of humanity for assistance whenever such appeal has reached them: Therefore be it 
"RESOLVED BY THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN CONGRESS ASSEMBLED, That in view of the wretchedness, misery, and privation which these people are enduring, the President of the United States be respectfully requested to designate and appoint a day on which the citizens of this country may give expression to their sympathy by contributing to the funds now being raised for the relief of the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) in the belligerent countries."
 
And Whereas,
 I feel confident that the people of the United States will be moved to aid these people stricken by war, famine and disease; 
Now, Therefore, I, Woodrow Wilson,
 President of the United States, in compliance with the request of the Congress of the United States do appoint and proclaim April 21, 1917, as a day upon which the people of the United States may make such contributions as they feel disposed for the aid of the stricken Ruthenians (Ukrainians) in the belligerent countries. 
Contributions may be addressed to the American Red Cross, Washington, D. C., which will care for their proper distribution. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seventeen, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and forty-first. 
WOODROW WILSON 
By the President: 
Robert Lansing, 
Secretary of State.
