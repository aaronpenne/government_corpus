A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the challenge of cancer has faced this Nation for many years and has been met, within the limits of our powers, by an expanded program of research, control, education, and service activities on the part of both public and private agencies; and
Whereas
, in spite of these efforts and the great advances made in our knowledge of cancer, this disease continues to be the second highest cause of death in the United States, taking more than 200,000 lives each year; and
Whereas
 the focusing of public attention in a special way upon the problem of controlling cancer will serve to give renewed life and vigor to the efforts directed toward solving it; and
Whereas
, by Public Resolution 82, 75th Congress, approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), the President is authorized and requested to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1952 as Cancer Control Month; and I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations. I also urge the medical profession, the press, the radio, television, and motion-picture industries, and all interested agencies and individuals to unite during April 1952 in public dedication to a program for the control of cancer.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 22nd day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
