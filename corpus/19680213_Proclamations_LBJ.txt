By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The history of the United States is not a record of blind forces sweeping human beings relentlessly along to an unknown destiny. It is the story of countless individuals whose success and sacrifice converted an idea into a free nation.
The heritage of liberty we enjoy was bought by men and women who dared the unknown, who tamed the wilderness, and gave their lives on fields of battle.
We honor them by remembering their deeds—and by telling their story to each succeeding generation.
The study of American history reveals the experience of shared endeavor, hardship, joy, and triumph which binds us together as a nation. Understanding that experience can give us the wisdom and courage to meet our present trials—and unite us in the face of tomorrow's challenges.
In recognition of this, the Congress by a joint resolution approved November 28, 1967, has designated February 1968 as American History Month and has requested the President to issue a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe that month.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, invite the people of the United States to observe February 1968 as American History Month in schools and other suitable places with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand, this thirteenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
