A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the health of the citizens of this Nation is vitally important to its strength; and
Whereas
 this Nation, in a grave period of world affairs, is called upon for strong and wise leadership; and
Whereas
 cancer, one of mankind's most insidious enemies, takes an annual toll of 177,000 American lives, and the National Cancer Institute in the United States Public Health Service estimates that 17,000,000 persons now living will perish of this disease unless a cure is found; and
Whereas
 medical science needs the cooperation of every individual and agency to further its fight for the control of this dread malady; and
Whereas
, by Public Resolution approved March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting apart the month of April of each year as Cancer Control Month:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set apart the month of April 1947 as Cancer Control Month, and do invite the Governors of the several States and the Territories and possessions of the United States to issue proclamations for a like purpose. I also invite the medical profession, the press, the radio, the motion picture industry, and all organizations and individuals interested in this momentous problem to unite during the month of April in a program of education in methods now available for the control of cancer, as well as a program of promotion of scientific research necessary to alleviate further the suffering caused by this scourge.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 21st day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
