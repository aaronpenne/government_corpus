By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
By Proclamation No. 4991 of October 27, 1982, the President suspended the application of the rates of duty provided for in column 1 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) to products of Poland. Proclamation No. 4991 is effective with respect to articles exported on and after November 1, 1982. 
Taking into account the factors cited in Proclamation No. 4991 and in order to alleviate unnecessary hardships to United States companies that entered into contracts before the decision to suspend most-favored-nation treatment for products of Poland was announced, I find it appropriate to amend Proclamation No. 4991 to permit articles that are exported to a consignee in the United States before June 30, 1983, pursuant to written and binding contracts to purchase executed on or before October 9, 1982, to enter at the column 1 rate of duty. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States including, but not limited to, the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, and the Trade Act of 1974, as amended, do proclaim that paragraph 3 of Proclamation No. 4991 of October 27, 1982, is hereby amended to read as follows: 
"(3) This Proclamation shall take effect with respect to articles exported on and after November 1, 1982, other than articles exported prior to June 30, 1983, to a consignee in the United States pursuant to a written and binding contract to purchase which was executed on or before October 9, 1982, provided that a copy of such contract is presented to the United States Customs Service on or before May 31, 1983 and the importer or consignee in the United States certifies that the articles are exported pursuant to that contract." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 14th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
