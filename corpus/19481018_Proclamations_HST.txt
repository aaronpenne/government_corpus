WILLIAM E. WARNE,
Acting Secretary of the Interior.

 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 3 of the said migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, do hereby approve and proclaim the foregoing regulation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third.
