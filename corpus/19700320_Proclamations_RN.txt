By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Cancer strikes Americans of all ages and in all walks of life. It continues to rank as the second greatest killer among diseases, and the death rate due to it is rising.
Research into this disease has progressed significantly in recent yearsâ€”in the areas of cause and treatment, as well as prevention. To build on this progress, this Administration's Fiscal Year 1971 budget increases Federal funds for cancer research by nearly 17 percent. This research attack will not overtake the onslaught of cancer unless all Americans encourage and support the intensive effort carried on by our scientists, physicians and health administrators against this menace to the health and welfare of our people.
In recognition of the urgency of the cancer problem, the Congress, by a joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148) requests the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1970 as Cancer Control Month, and I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations.
I also ask the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all other interested persons and groups to unite during the appointed month in public reaffirmation of this nation's efforts to control cancer.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
