By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 388, 389), and the act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 325, 326), it is ordered that all periods of trust on Indian allotted or tribal lands in the State of Oklahoma upon which the periods of trust expire during the calendar year 1936, be, and they are hereby, extended for a period of 10 years from the dates on which such trusts would otherwise expire.
This order is not intended to apply to cases in which Congress has specifically reserved to itself authority to extend the period of trust on tribal or individual Indian lands.
