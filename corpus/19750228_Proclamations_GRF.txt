By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
AMENDING PROCLAMATION NOs. 4313 AND 4345 TO FURTHER EXTEND THE APPLICATION PERIOD OF THE PROGRAM FOR THE RETURN OF VIETNAM ERA DRAFT EVADERS AND MILITARY DESERTERS 
On September 16, 1974, I issued Proclamation No. 4313, announcing a program of earned return for those convicted and accused of violating certain provisions of the Selective Service Act or the Uniform Code of Military justice during the Vietnam conflict. On January 30, 1975, I amended that Proclamation extending the date by which applications must be received until March 1, 1975. 
Based on a further review of the progress of this program, I believe that many of those who have already been punished are only now learning they are eligible. This is confirmed by the large number of applications which continue to be filed with the Presidential Clemency Board. Therefore, I am again extending the date by which all applications must be received. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to my powers under Article II of the Constitution, do hereby proclaim that Proclamation No. 4313 is hereby amended as follows : 
SECTION 1. Paragraph (i) of Section 1 is amended to read as follows : 
"presents himself to a United States Attorney before March 31, 1975." 
SEC. 2. The first paragraph of Section 2 is amended by striking out the date "March 1, 1975," after the words "offenses directly related thereto if before" and inserting in place thereof "March 31, 1975,". 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
