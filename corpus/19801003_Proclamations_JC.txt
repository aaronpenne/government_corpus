By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Our Nation's seaports and river ports, operated by local and State authorities, are indispensable to our national prosperity and international commerce. 
Historically, waterborne commerce has been a key element in the development and growth of most of the Nation's major population and commercial centers. Today public and privately owned marine terminals, valued at about $54 billion, are expected to handle almost two billion short tons of foreign and domestic oceanborne cargo in 1980. 
In addition to the economic benefits provided by our ports, they play a leading role in logistical support of our military forces. Our port system has been and will continue to be vital in maintaining our national security. 
The Congress has by House Joint Resolution 551 requested the President to designate the seven calendar days beginning October 5, 1980, as National Port Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in order to remind Americans of the importance of the port industry of the United States to our national life, do hereby designate the seven calendar days beginning October 5, 1980, as National Port Week. I invite the Governors of the several States, the chief officials of local governments, and the people of the United States to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
JIMMY CARTER
