By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Patterns of living and working have changed during our two centuries as a Nation, and the American family has changed with them. Participation in family life is more and more a personal choice, less and less an economic and social necessity. 
But even as customs have changed and many of the traditional sanctions have lost their force, the overwhelming majority of Americans have still chosen the rewards of family life. It is within the family that we first learn to communicate with other people, to give and receive love and understanding, to work together for common goals, and to respect the rights, needs and talents of others. The family teaches us responsibility and compassion, it encourages our best efforts, and it forgives our failures. It fills many of the gaps left by other institutions in our society. As a Nation we must strengthen and support the values of family life for they are inseparable from our finest national traits. 
In honoring the family it is especially appropriate to acknowledge those Americans who, through adoption, open their homes and hearts to wanted children. They bring a special commitment to the family and share a special reward in nurturing their children and seeing them grow in love. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of the Congress, approved August 15, 1977 (91 Stat. 836) do hereby proclaim the week of November 20, 1977, as National Family Week and call upon the American people to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies, programs and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
