Whereas
 pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 1 of the Act of June 12, 1934, by the joint resolution approved June 7, 1943, by sections 2 and 3 of the Act of July 5, 1945, and by sections 4 and 6 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 (ch. 474, 48 Stat. 943; ch. 118, 57 Stat. 125; ch. 269, 59 Stat. 410 and 411; 63 Stat. 698), the period for the exercise of the said authority having been extended by section 3 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1948) on April 21, 1951, I entered into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade of the Governments of the Republic of Austria, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Republic of Korea, the Republic of the Philippines, the Republic of Peru, and the Republic of Turkey and for the application of the relevant provisions of the said General Agreement to additional schedules of concessions relating to countries already contracting parties thereto, including the Kingdom of Belgium, the United States of Brazil, Canada, the Kingdom of Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the French Republic, the Republic of Indonesia, the Italian Republic, the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, the Kingdom of Norway, and the Kingdom of Sweden, which trade agreement consists of the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated April 21, 1951, including the annexes thereto ("The Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and the Torquay Schedules of Tariff Concessions", Geneva, 1951);
2. 
Whereas
, by Proclamation No. 2929 of June 2, 1951 (16 F.R. 5381), I proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement on and after June 6, 1951, which proclamation has been supplemented by notifications of the President to the Secretary of the Treasury of June 2, 1951 (16 F.R. 5386), June 29, 1951 (16 F.R. 6607), July 23, 1951 (16 F.R. 7379), September 10, 1951, as amended (16 F.R. 9215; 16 F.R. 9715), September 18, 1951 (16 F.R. 9551), and October 2, 1951 (16 F.R. 10047);

Whereas
, item 1530(c) in Part I of Schedule XX contained in Annex A to the said Torquay Protocol reads as follows.
4. 
Whereas
 the first subdivision of the item specified in the third recital of this proclamation was not intended to cover chamois leather, but such leather inadvertently was not excluded from the description of the products on which the concession was granted, and the rate of duty specified at the right of the description of products in the said item 1530(c) has been applied to chamois leather since June 6, 1951, pursuant to notification by the President to the Secretary of the Treasury (16 F.R. 5386) that on and after such date the concession represented by such rate should not be withheld;
5. 
Whereas
, after being notified by the United States of its intention to effect the withdrawal of the said concession on chamois leather, the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement have interposed no objection to such withdrawal; and
6. 
Whereas
 the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, authorizes the President to terminate in whole or in part any proclamation carrying out a trade agreement entered into under such section;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including the said section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by the acts specified in the first recital of this proclamation, do proclaim that the said proclamation of June 2, 1951 is hereby terminated in part, to the extent that after the close of business November 19, 1951, it shall be applied as though item 1530(c) in Part I of Schedule XX contained in Annex A to the said Torquay Protocol were stated as follows:
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
