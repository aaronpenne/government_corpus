By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
As a nation we seek no imposition of our beliefs. But as human beings, we must always keep alive the hope that our great heritage of freedom will one day be enjoyed throughout the world.
As we make progress toward world peace and security, let us continue to show our sympathies for others who aspire to liberty and self-determination. In support of this sentiment, the Eighty-Sixth Congress on July 17, 1959, by a joint resolution, authorized and requested the President to proclaim the third week in July in each year as Captive Nations Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 15, 1973, as Captive Nations Week.
I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge rededication to the high purpose of individual liberty for all men.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
