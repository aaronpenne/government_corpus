By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Nearly one thousand years ago, Leif Erikson and his small crew of Norse explorers embarked upon a courageous voyage through unknown seas that led them to the bountiful shores of the New World. 
Today most of the world's frontiers have been explored but there are still personal frontiers that are no less challenging and forbidding than those faced so many years ago. As we push forward, let us draw inspiration from the indomitable spirit and undaunting determination of Leif Erikson. His achievement is a beacon for all men and women of vision who navigate the rough waters of uncertainty and adversity. 
I am honored to comply with the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, October 9, 1974, as Leif Erikson Day and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
