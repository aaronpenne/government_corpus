A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Leif Erikson, Norseman, son of Erik the Red and great seafarer, in the year 1000 valiantly explored the shores of the American Continent; and 
Whereas
 the intrepid exploits of the Vikings of Erikson's time strike a responsive chord in the hearts of all the American people, who as a nation are today embarked upon an adventurous exploration of the unfathomed realms of space; and 
Whereas
 many of our citizens of Scandinavian descent take inspiration from and annually celebrate Leif Erikson's momentous voyage; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States by a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964, has authorized the President of the United States to proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 9, 1964, as Leif Erikson Day and direct Government officials to display the flag on all Government buildings on that day. Further, I invite the people of the United States to honor on that day the memory of Leif Erikson by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

DEAN RUSK,
