By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Americans carved a nation out of the wilderness. Now we must preserve the wilderness for the Nation.
The theme of this year's National Wildlife Week is: "Discover Wildlifeâ€”It's Too Good To Miss." In a greater sense, Americans are rediscovering the natural animal world around them. Our concern for the fate of wild animals has increased. We have come to realize that the development of the human habitat has occurred at great cost to another kind of habitat. And we are seeking more effective ways to preserve and enhance our wilderness areas.
All men need refuges for their spirit. The wilderness invokes contemplation and provides recreation, and the animal wildlife of America provides a fascinating dimension to our natural heritage which we know must be preserved for future generations to enjoy.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 18, 1973, as National Wildlife Week.
I ask all citizens to renew their efforts to preserve and enhance our natural environment, especially those areas now inhabited by our natural wildlife. Because the need is still great for better tools with which to do the job, I also urge the Congress once again to act promptly on my proposal to strengthen protection for hundreds of endangered species.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
