Whereas one of the most important and urgent problems confronting this Nation today is the development of a positive food and nutrition program for all Americans; 
Whereas I have received the report of the Task Force on Area Redevelopment under the chairmanship of Senator Douglas, in which special emphasis is placed upon the need for additional food to supplement the diets of needy persons in areas of chronic unemployment; 
Whereas I am also advised that there are now almost 7 million persons receiving some form of public assistance, that 4.5 million persons are reported as being unemployed and that a substantial number of needy persons are not recipients in the present food distribution program; 
Whereas the variety of foods currently being made available is limited and its nutritional content inadequate; and 
Whereas despite an abundance of food, farm income has been in a period of decline, and a strengthening of farm prices is desirable. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows: 
The Secretary of Agriculture shall take immediate steps to expand and improve the program of food distribution throughout the United States, utilizing funds and existing statutory authority available to him, including section 32 of the Act of August 24,1935, as amended (7 U.S.C. 612), so as to make available for distribution, through appropriate State and local agencies, to all needy families a greater variety and quantity of food out of our agricultural abundance.
