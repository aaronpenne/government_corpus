A Proclamation
 
Memorial Day each year provides a fitting occasion upon which American citizens, who have ever been devoted to the ways of peace, may direct their attention to the human losses resulting from the ravages of war.
From the sacred memory of beloved friends and relatives who were sacrificed in the ordeal of battle, we may derive inspiration for renewed prayers and redoubled exertions in a mighty striving for peace.
Although the months and years after the end of hostilities in the world's most tragic war are steadily passing, mankind has not yet found the long-sought basis of an unbreakable, righteous peace. In all humility we wish to acknowledge our need for divine guidance.
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to a resolution of Congress approved May 28, 1948, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe Sunday, May 30, 1948, as Memorial Day by praying to Almighty God, each in accordance with his religious faith, that permanent peace may prevail among men. And I designate the hour beginning at eight o'clock in the evening, Eastern Standard Time, as a period in which all the people of the United States may unite in prayer for a permanent peace.
I also request the newspapers, radio stations, and other media of information to cooperate in the observance of Memorial Day this year as a day of prayer, and particularly in the appeal for a universal prayer in the evening of that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 28th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN

ROBERT A. LOVETT,
Acting Secretary of State.
