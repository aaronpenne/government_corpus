By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 6 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness maintains a constant surveillance of imports of petroleum and its primary derivatives and their effect on national security. The Director has found that changes in the supply of and demand for petroleum and its derivatives have been occurring rapidly and additional flexibility should be provided for the orderly administration of Proclamation 3279, as amended, during the remainder of 1972. Therefore, the Director has recommended, with the advice of the Oil Policy Committee, that additional imports of No. 2 fuel oil be permitted and that holders of certain allocations under said Proclamation should be permitted to import petroleum and its derivatives in advance of allocations to be made for 1973.
I agree with the above finding and recommendation of the Director and deem it necessary and consistent with the security objectives of Proclamation 3279, as amended, to adjust the imports of petroleum and petroleum products, and to improve the administration of the program, as hereinafter provided.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that, effective as of this date, Proclamation 3279, as amended, is further amended as follows:
1. In subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of section 2, add the following sentence after the third sentence, "In addition to the quantity of No. 2 fuel oil provided in the preceding sentence, the Secretary may allocate for the period January 1, 1972, through December 31, 1972, an additional 5,000 barrels per day of such fuel oil to persons who qualify for allocations under the preceding sentence."
2. Add the following subparagraph (3) in paragraph (a) of section 2:
"(3) For the allocation period January 1, 1972, through December 31, 1972, the Secretary may make allocations in excess of the levels provided in subparagraph (1) of this paragraph which excess allocations may be imported at any time through December 31, 1973. However, no allocation under this subparagraph shall be made to any person to whom an allocation was not made prior to September 1, 1972, and any such excess allocation shall not exceed 10% of the allocations made to any such allocation holder prior to September 1, 1972 for the allocation year commencing January 1, 1972. Any such excess allocation shall be deducted from any allocation which may be hereafter made to him for the period January 1, 1973, through December 31, 1973."
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
