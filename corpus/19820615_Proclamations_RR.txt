By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Peaches are a refreshing and nutritious addition to our Nation's diet. 
Peaches are a $365 million cash crop that bolsters the economies of 32 States. 
The United States is the world's largest peach producer, providing more than 20 percent of the world's peaches and exporting approximately 250 million pounds each year. 
In recognition of the role peaches play in our food supply and our economy, the Congress by Joint Resolution approved March 16, 1982 (96 Stat. 12), has requested the President to designate July 1982 as "National Peach Month." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim July 1982 "National Peach Month" and call upon the people of the United States to incorporate this nutritious fruit into their diets, and call upon interested groups to celebrate this month with appropriate programs and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 15th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
