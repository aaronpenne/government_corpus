By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
February 17 will mark the thirty-ninth anniversary of the founding of the League of United Latin American Citizens, popularly known as LULAC.
LULAC is a nonprofit, nonpolitical civic organization interested in the progress and advancement of Latin Americans in this country. Its dedicated members work with young Americans of Spanish-speaking background to:
—train them to become citizens.
—provide them with educational opportunities.
—promote the highest standards of patriotism among them.
In recognition of these and other civic contributions of LULAC, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved February 10, 1968, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period February 11 through 17, 1968, as LULAC Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of February 11 through February 17, 1968, as LULAC Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
