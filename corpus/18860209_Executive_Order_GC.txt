Tidings of the death of Winfield Scott Hancock, the senior major-general of the Army of the United States, have just been received. A patriotic and valiant defender of his country, an able and heroic soldier, a spotless and accomplished gentleman, crowned alike with the laurels of military renown and the highest tribute of his fellow-countrymen to his worth as a citizen, he has gone to his reward.
It is fitting that every mark of public respect should be paid to his memory.
Therefore it is now ordered by the President that the national flag be displayed at half-mast upon all the buildings of the Executive Departments in this city until after his funeral shall have taken place.
By direction of the President:
DANIEL S. LAMONT,
 Private Secretary.
