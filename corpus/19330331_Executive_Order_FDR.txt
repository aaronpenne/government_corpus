Veterans Regulations No. 4
Protected Awards
WHEREAS, section 17, title I, of Public No. 2, 73d Congress, entitled "An act to maintain the credit of the United States Government", provides: 
The provisions of this title shall not apply to compensation or pension (except as to rates, time of entry into active service, and special statutory allowances) being paid to veterans disabled, or dependents of veterans who died, as the result of disease or injury directly connected with active military or naval service (without benefit of statutory or regulatory presumption of service connected) pursuant to the provisions of the laws in effect on the date of the enactment of this act. The term "compensation or pension" as used in this paragraph shall not be construed to include emergency officers' retired pay referred to in section 10 of this title. 
NOW, therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by said law, the following regulation is hereby promulgated: 
I. The provisions of title I, Public 2, 73d Congress, and the regulations issued pursuant thereto shall not be applicable to any claim wherein compensation or pension is being paid based on a finding heretofore made pursuant to law that the injury or disease causing disability or death was directly connected with active military or naval service, except where under the provisions of title I, Public 2, 73d Congress, and regulations issued pursuant thereto the rate of disability or requirement as to time of entry into active service has been changed or payment is based on a statutory allowance. The protection afforded by section 17 is not applicable to any claim wherein the injury or disease causing disability or death has been connected with active military or naval service by virtue of any statutory or regulatory presumption of service connection.
