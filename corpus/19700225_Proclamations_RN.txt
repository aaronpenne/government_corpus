By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In a democracy like the United States of America, we learn early that each one of us has a responsibility not only to himself, but to his fellow citizens, and to the nation as a whole. As the world around us grows smaller, our sense of responsibility to mankind has extended until it includes the peoples of the entire earth.
Nowhere is the compassionate feeling for mankind, and his welfare, better exemplified than in the mission of the Red Cross. The humanitarian work of the Red Cross is recognized by all nations. For eighty-nine years the American Red Cross has served this nation and its people unselfishly, while constantly striving to do more.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America and Honorary Chairman of the American National Red Cross, do hereby designate March, 1970, as Red Cross Month, a time when the organization will ask for your active support. I urge every American to do his utmost to secure the strength of the Red Cross by serving as a volunteer if possible and by contributing to his full ability.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 25th day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
