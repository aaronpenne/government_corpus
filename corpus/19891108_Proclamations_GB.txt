By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On November 8, 1889, Montana was admitted to the Union as the 41st State. In the century that has followed, the people of Montana have built upon their frontier heritage and made substantial contributions to our Nation's economic and social well-being. 
During their famous expedition early in the 19th century, Captains Meriwether Lewis and William Clark introduced this "Big Sky Country" to the world. By wagon train and later by railroad, a rush of homesteaders seized the opportunity to cultivate this new land and enjoy its abundant natural resources. Our Nation's fourth largest State is now home to a number of important industries -- such as farming, ranching, mining, and tourism -- that utilize its spectacular wealth of forests, prairies, wildlife, minerals, and natural beauty. Montanans are a proud, hardworking, and community-minded people who have added strength and color to the character of America. 
In recognition of these contributions, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 19, has designated November 8, 1989, as "Montana Centennial Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 8, 1989, as Montana Centennial Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
