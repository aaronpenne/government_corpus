By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
For more than sixty years, the Jaycees have brought together outstanding young members of communities throughout the Nation to help meet the vital needs of our ever-changing and increasingly complex society. Motivated by their creed "Service to humanity is the best work of life," hundreds of thousands of Jaycees have voluntarily contributed their energy to a wide variety of humanitarian projects and have thereby enriched their country, their communities and their own lives. 
As a training ground for new leaders, the Jaycees have made their most valuable and lasting contribution to our society. This organization has for generations launched young Americans on careers of leadership in every field of endeavor. 
In recognition of the accomplishments of this organization, the Congress of the United States, by Senate Joint Resolution 240, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the week beginning on January 16, 1983, as "National Jaycee Week." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 16, 1983, as National Jaycee Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that period with appropriate programs, ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
