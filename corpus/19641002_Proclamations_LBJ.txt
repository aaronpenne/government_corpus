A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United Nations General Assembly has designated the year 1965 as International Cooperation Year; and 
Whereas
 the year 1965 also marks the twentieth anniversary of the United Nations; and 
Whereas
 international cooperation is essential to the achievement of a peaceful world order; and 
Whereas
 international organizations are vital in the modern world and provide the necessary foundation for a peaceful world community; and 
Whereas
 the world has moved rapidly toward international cooperation and organization in recent years-especially within the family of the United Nations agencies; and 
Whereas
 the movement for international cooperation has had, and will continue to have, the enthusiastic support of the Government of the United States of America; and 
Whereas
 it is highly desirable to assess this development and examine promptly what further steps can be taken in the immediate future toward enhancing international cooperation and strengthening world organization: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby 
--proclaim the year 1965 to be International Cooperation Year in the United States of America; 
--rededicate the Government of the United States to the principle of international cooperation; and 
--direct the agencies of the Executive Branch to examine thoroughly what additional steps can be taken in this direction in the immediate future. 
I also call upon our national citizen organizations to undertake intensive educational programs to inform their memberships of recent progress in international cooperation and urge them to consider what further steps can be taken. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-ninth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
