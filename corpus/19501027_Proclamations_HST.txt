A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 on November 11, 1918, an armistice was signed in the Forest of Compiegne, ending hostilities in World War I and giving hope to mankind that forces of aggression would be permanently suppressed; and
Whereas
 a harrowing second world conflict has created in the hearts and minds of men a firm determination to make a lasting peace; and
Whereas
, although the peoples of the world are again saddened by strife and bloodshed, our faith has grown in the ultimate fulfillment, through international effort, of the promise for which our heroes fought and died; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a concurrent resolution of June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of November 11 as the anniversary of the armistice of 1918, and by an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), declared that the anniversary should thenceforth be a legal holiday dedicated to the cause of world peace, and should be known as Armistice Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all our people to observe Saturday, November 11, 1950, as Armistice Day by paying solemn tribute to our fellow countrymen who fought on foreign soil for liberty, and by praying for divine help in the achievement of peace on earth; and I direct that the flag of the United States be flown from all Government buildings on that date in recognition of past and present efforts and sacrifice toward the end that international hostilities may be ended forever.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
