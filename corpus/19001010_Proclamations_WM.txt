By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas it is provided by section twenty-four of the act of Congress, approved March 3rd, 1891, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof;"
And whereas the public lands in the State of Wyoming, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the aforesaid act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there is hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public Reservation all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Wyoming and particularly described as follows, to wit:
Beginning at the northeast corner of township fifteen (15) north, range seventy-one (71) west, sixth (6th) principal meridian, Wyoming; thence westerly along the township line to the northwest corner of section three (3), township fifteen (15) north, range seventy-two (72) west; thence southerly to the southwest corner section thirty-four (34), said township; thence easterly to the southeast corner of said section; thence southerly to the southwest corner of section eleven (11), township fourteen (14) north, range seventy-two (72) west; thence easterly to the southeast corner of section twelve (12), said township; thence southerly to the southwest corner of section thirty (30), township fourteen (14) north, range seventy-one (71) west; thence easterly to the southeast corner of section twenty-five (25), said township; thence northerly along the range line to the northeast corner of township fifteen (15) north, range seventy-one (71) west, the place of beginning.
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired: Provided, that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the tract of land reserved by this proclamation.
The reservation hereby established shall be known as The Crow Creek Forest Reserve.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 10th day of October, A.D. 1900, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-fifth.
