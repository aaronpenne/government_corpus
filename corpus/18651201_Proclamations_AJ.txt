A Proclamation
 
Whereas by the proclamation of the President of the United States of the 15th day of September, 1863, the privilege of the writ of
 habeas corpus
 was, in certain cases therein set forth, suspended throughout the United States; and
Whereas the reasons for that suspension may be regarded as having ceased in some of the States and Territories:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, do hereby proclaim and declare that the suspension aforesaid and all other proclamations and orders suspending the privilege of the writ of
 habeas corpus
 in the States and Territories of the United States are revoked and annulled, excepting as to the States of Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, Arkansas, and Texas, the District of Columbia, and the Territories of New Mexico and Arizona.
In witness whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 1st day of December, A.D. 1865, and of the Independence of the United States of America the ninetieth.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
By the President:
WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
 Secretary of State.
