By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Once again it is appropriate for Americans to honor the intrepid Norse explorers who overcame hardship and adversity to reach our shores so long ago. 
The United States is a young Nation, but our debt to that courageous Norseperson, Leif Erikson, predates 1776 and recalls a distant age when brave adventurers sailed forth into the unknown. As a people we continue to embody this spirit of bold discovery, and we take pride in his historical exploits. 
As a mark of respect for Leif Erikson and the Norse explorers, the Congress of the United States, by joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849, 36 U.S.C. 169c), authorized the President to proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 9, 1977, as Leif Erikson Day and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-third day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
