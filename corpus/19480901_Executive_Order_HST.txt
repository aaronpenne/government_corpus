By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Civil Service Act (22 Stat. 403) and by section 1753 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, section 1 of Executive Order No. 9952 of April 22, 1948, providing for the termination of reemployment rights of Federal civilian employees who transferred to public or private agencies for national-defense or war work, is hereby amended to read as follows:
1. All existing reemployment rights to positions in the Federal service acquired under authority of Executive Order No. 8973 of December 12, 1941, Executive Order No. 9067 of February 20, 1942, or Directive No. X as amended by Directive No. XVI of the War Manpower Commission (7 F.R. 7298, 11050), or under regulations of the Civil Service Commission issued pursuant thereto, shall expire on October 22, 1948, unless application for reemployment under such rights shall have been made before that date: Provided, that nothing in this order shall prevent the exercise of such reemployment rights on or after October 22, 1948, (a) by any employee who on that date is serving in a Federal agency which on that date is being liquidated or is required by statute to be liquidated; or (b) by any person upon separation from the armed forces or release from the merchant marine if at the time of his entry into the armed forces or merchant marine he would have acquired restoration rights had he entered such service from the agency from which he originally transferred: And Provided further, that any person who subsequent to October 22, 1948, takes any action which results in the extension of his period of service in the armed forces or merchant marine may not exercise such reemployment rights upon separation or release therefrom.
