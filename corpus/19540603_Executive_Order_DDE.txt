By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act, approved December 29, 1945 (59 Stat. 669), and having found that the United States participates in the Organization of American States pursuant to the treaty of April 30, 1948 (T. I. A. S. 2361), I hereby designate such organization as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act.
The designation of the Organization of American States as a public international organization within the meaning of the International Organizations Immunities Act is not intended to abridge in any respect privileges, exemptions, and immunities which the Organization may have acquired or may acquire by treaty or congressional action.
The designation of the Organization of American States made by this order shall be deemed to include the designation of the Pan American Union, and the designation of the Pan American Union made by Executive Order No. 9698 of February 19, 1946, is hereby superseded.
