By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 U.S.C. 1701 et seq.), the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) (NEA), section 5 of the United Nations Participation Act of 1945, as amended (22 U.S.C. 287c), and section 301 of title 3, United States Code, and in view of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1448 of December 9, 2002,
I, George W. Bush, President of the United States of America, find that the situation that gave rise to the declaration of a national emergency in Executive Order 12865 of September 26, 1993, with respect to the actions and policies of the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), and that led to the steps taken in that order and in Executive Order 13069 of December 12, 1997, and Executive Order 13098 of August 18, 1998, has been significantly altered by the recent and continuing steps toward peace taken by the Government of Angola and UNITA.
