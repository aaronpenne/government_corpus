By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Crime continues to be of deep concern to the American people. The fight against crime requires voluntary citizen cooperation with law enforcement officials. 
We recognize the growth and the proven effectiveness of local crime watch organizations throughout the country. They have played a major role in turning the tide against crime. People working together with their local law enforcement agencies have always been the best deterrent to crime. 
Citizens all across America will soon take part in a "National Night Out" to demonstrate the importance and effectiveness of community participation in crime prevention efforts. Those who take part will spend the period from 8:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. on August 12, 1986, with their neighbors in front of their homes. 
Americans should be aware of the significance of community crime prevention programs and the ways in which they can reduce crime in our towns and neighborhoods. This Administration has made crime prevention a top priority. We support efforts to repeat the highly visible "National Night Out" as a way of calling attention to the need for citizen-based crime prevention programs. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 256, has designated August 12, 1986, as "National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim August 12, 1986, as National Neighborhood Crime Watch Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
