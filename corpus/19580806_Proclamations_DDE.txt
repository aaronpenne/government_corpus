A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 fire-prevention practices by the American people can avert much human suffering and save great loss of property; and
Whereas
 each citizen should contribute wholeheartedly to effective fire-prevention work urgently needed in every community of our land:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower

I call upon the people to promote programs for the prevention and control of fires; and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public-information agencies, to share actively in observing Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national effort to reduce the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
