By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Inter-American System is the oldest, most successful regional association in the world. On April 14, 1969, we celebrate the 79th Anniversary of its formation.
The Americas are bound together by history, geography and, most important of all, common concerns and shared hopes.
On this occasion, the United States reaffirms its dedication to:
—Close consultation with its Hemisphere partners in all matters of common concern.
—Furtherance of social and cultural ties that enhance human dignity and mutual respect.
—Cooperation with each of our partners in economic development that will benefit the entire Hemisphere.
Within this unity of purpose there is room for a diversity of viewpoint and approach. The United States seeks to cooperate, not to dominate; to participate fairly as a partner in the responsibilities that each nation shares within the System.
Much has been accomplished by the nations of our continents; the Organization of American States, focus of the Inter-American System, is stronger than ever, with a revised Charter soon coming into effect.
We shall treat with high priority the tasks that lie ahead—to extend to all Americans the opportunity for lives of dignity in a climate of freedom.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, April 14, 1969, as Pan American Day, and the week beginning April 13 and ending April 19 as Pan American Week; and I call upon the Governors of the fifty States of the Union, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and the officials of all other areas under the flag of the United States to issue similar proclamations.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
