The heads of departments, agencies, and independent establishments shall, to the extent consistent with the needs of the service, adopt a liberal policy for the granting of annual leave to all employees who wish to take such leave over the holiday period.
This order shall not be construed as excusing from duty those employees of the Department of State, the Department of Defense, or other departments, establishments, or agencies who for national security or other public reasons should, in the judgment of the respective heads thereof, be at their posts of duty.
