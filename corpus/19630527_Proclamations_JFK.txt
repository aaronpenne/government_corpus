By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, the. Bandelier National Monument, New Mexico, was established for the preservation and protection of prehistoric, aboriginal ruins by Proclamation No. 1322 of February 11, 1916 (39 Stat. 1764), and was enlarged by Proclamation No. 1991 of February 25, 1932 (47 Stat. 2503), and Proclamation No. 3388 of January 9, 1961 (75 Stat. 1014); and 
Whereas
, certain lands of the United States comprising approximately 2882 acres, contiguous to and west of lands of the monument, formerly administered by the Atomic Energy Commission were determined to be in excess of the needs of that agency, and were transferred to the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior on March 5, 1963, with the approval of the General Services Administration; and 
Whereas
, it appears that it would be in the public interest to add such transferred lands to the Bandelier National Monument because they possess unusual scenic character together with geologic and topographic features, the preservation of which would implement the purposes of such monument; and 
Whereas
, it appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude from the detached Otowi section of the monument approximately 3,925 acres of land containing limited archeological values which have been fully researched and are not needed to complete the interpretive story of the Bandelier National Monument: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 2 of the Act of June 8, 1906 (34 Stat. 225; 16 U.S.C. 431), and otherwise, do proclaim as follows:
