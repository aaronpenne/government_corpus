By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 September 17, 1962, marks the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Constitution of the United States on September 17, 1787; and 
Whereas
 the strength and freedom of our Nation and the fundamental and inalienable rights of our citizens are derived from the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 it is imperative in this time of world uncertainty and unrest that each citizen, naturalized or native-born, be conversant with the acts and events that led to the formulation and adoption of the Constitution in order that he may fully appreciate the meaning and significance of that document and our constitutional form of government; and 
Whereas
 it is fitting and proper on the one hundred and seventy-fifth anniversary of the signing of the Constitution that each citizen renew his pledge to serve his country and to stand ever ready to preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved February 29, 1952 (66 Stat. 9), the Congress designated the seventeenth day of September of each year as Citizenship Day in commemoration of the signing of the Constitution on September 17, 1787, and in recognition of those citizens who have come of age and those who have been naturalized during the year; and 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved August 2, 1956 (70 Stat. 932), the Congress requested the President to designate the week beginning September 17 of each year as Constitution Week--a time for the study and observance of the acts and events which resulted in the formation of the Constitution; and 
Whereas
 those resolutions of the Congress authorize the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of Citizenship Day and of Constitution Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1962; and I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as all religious, civic, educational, and other organizations, to hold appropriate ceremonies on that day to inspire all our citizens to rededicate themselves to the Faith of our Founding Fathers and to the ideals upon which this Nation was established and built. 
I also designate the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1962, as Constitution Week; and I urge the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools and churches and in other suitable places to the end that our citizens may have a better understanding of the Constitution and of the privileges and obligations of United States citizenship. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this Fifth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
