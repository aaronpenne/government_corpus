By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The fabric of American society is woven around the family and at the center of the family is the father.
Fatherhood can be one of the most enriching and most satisfying experiences in a man's life. But the role of the father is not an easy one. Often, his sacrifices are taken for granted, and—even at the times of greatest stress—he must always stand steady, providing the strength and stability on which a sound family life depends.
A man does not need to be applauded or given a citation for being a good father. Fatherhood is its own reward. But it is appropriate that the Nation pause every so often to recognize the contributions which the fathers of America have made to their families, their communities, and their country.
To that end, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved December 28, 1970, designated the third Sunday in June of 1971 as Father's Day and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, June 20, 1971, be observed as Father's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places.
I invite the governments of the States and communities to observe Father's Day with appropriate ceremonies and I urge our people to offer public and private expressions on that day of the abiding love and gratitude which they bear for the fathers of our land.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
