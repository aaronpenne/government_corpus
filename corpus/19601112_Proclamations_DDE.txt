A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 15, 1960, marks the one hundred and sixty-ninth anniversary of the adoption of the first ten amendments to the Constitution of the United States, which are known as the Bill of Rights; and
Whereas
 December 10, 1960, marks the twelfth anniversary of the adoption by the General Assembly of the United Nations of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights; and
Whereas
 people in many parts of the world will be observing this anniversary for the first time as citizens of newly independent nations; and
Whereas
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights gives voice to the aspirations of all peoples for equality under God and for their rights and responsibilities in self-governing societies; and
Whereas
 our Bill of Rights is one of the sources of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and is reflected in many of its provisions:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period from December 10 to December 17, 1960, as Human Rights Week, to the end that we may rededicate ourselves to the full achievement of the objectives set forth by our Bill of Rights and to the support of the United Nations' objectives of peace and human rights for all, without distinction as to race, sex, language, or religion.
Let each of us examine his conscience, so that we may be more sensitive to the needs and worth of every individual. Let us remember that it is only through free and responsible efforts that humanity can make lasting progress toward the goal of peace with justice, and let us direct our actions so as to encourage these efforts in every country by strengthening their foundations in our own.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
