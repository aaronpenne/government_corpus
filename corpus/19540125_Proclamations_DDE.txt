A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the members of the armed forces of the United States have constantly demonstrated their loyalty and devotion to the service of their country; and
Whereas
 the men and women of the armed forces are actively engaged, at home and overseas, in upholding and defending our democratic way of life as opposed to ideologies which seek to destroy the basic principles of freedom cherished by this Nation; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that on a special day each year our armed forces demonstrate to the people of the United States and our friends overseas their increased teamwork and efficiency and their technological advances; and
Whereas
 it is fitting and proper that all our citizens devote one day each year to paying special tribute to our fighting forces as the protectors and defenders of our Nation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America and Commander in Chief of the armed forces of the United States, do hereby proclaim Saturday, May 15, 1954, as Armed Forces Day; and I direct the Secretary of Defense and the Secretaries of the Army, the Navy, and the Air Force, as well as the Secretary of the Treasury on behalf of the Coast Guard, to mark that day with appropriate ceremonies and to cooperate with civil authorities in suitable observances.
I invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to provide for the celebration of the day in such manner as will pay suitable honor to the members of the armed forces.
I also call upon my fellow citizens not only to display the flag of the United States on Armed Forces Day, but also to manifest their recognition of the sacrifice and devotion to duty of the men and women of the armed forces by attending and participating in the local observances of the day conducted by the armed forces and the civil authorities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 25th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

WALTER B. SMITH,
