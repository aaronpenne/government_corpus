By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
One hundred and eighty-eight years ago, Casimir Pulaski gave his life so that a young and valiant nation might live in freedom.
Barely thirty years old when, as a Polish patriot in exile, he came to fight with George Washington's Revolutionary Army, General Pulaski was richly endowed with the qualities of dedication and courage that have been the source of America's greatest strength.
He organized the first American cavalry unit, known as the Pulaski Legion, and served with great distinction at Brandywine and Germantown. He was mortally wounded on October 9, 1779 while leading his cavalry unit in a daring charge during the Battle of Savannah.
General Pulaski held the conviction that freedom is a nation's most cherished possession—that the erosion of freedom anywhere weakens freedom everywhere. Americans have fought many times for that conviction. We are fighting for it today in Vietnam.
In memory of a gallant defender of our Nation, let us rededicate ourselves to the principles for which he gave his life—principles which millions of Polish immigrants to America have defended and strengthened over the years.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, October 11, 1967, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. I also invite the people of the United States to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski and his dedication to the defense of liberty.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand, this 26th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
