By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
To the People of the United States:
 
A noble and compassionate leader, a good and faithful servant of the people, in the full vigor of his promise, lies dead from an assassin's bullet. 
The tragedy and the senseless violence of Robert F. Kennedy's death casts a deep shadow of grief across America and across the world. 
This is a moment for all Americans to join hands and walk together through this dark night of common anguish into a new dawn of healing unity.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States, do call upon all Americans to observe Sunday next, the ninth day of June, as a day of national mourning in his memory throughout the United States. In our churches, in our homes, and in our hearts let us resolve before God and before each other that the purpose of progress and justice for which Robert F. Kennedy lived shall endure. 
I direct that until interment the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff on all buildings, grounds and naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions.
I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixtyeight and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
