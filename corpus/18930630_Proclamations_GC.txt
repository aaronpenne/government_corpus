A Proclamation
 
Whereas the distrust and apprehension concerning the financial situation which pervade all business circles have already caused great loss and damage to our people and threaten to cripple our merchants, stop the wheels of manufacture, bring distress and privation to our farmers, and withhold from our workingmen the wage of labor; and
Whereas the present perilous condition is largely the result of a financial policy which the executive branch of the Government finds embodied in unwise laws, which must be executed until repealed by Congress:
Now, therefore, I, Grover Cleveland, President of the United States, in performance of a constitutional duty, do by this proclamation declare that an extraordinary occasion requires the convening of both Houses of the Congress of the United States at the Capitol, in the city of Washington, on the 7th day of August next, at 12 o'clock noon, to the end that the people may be relieved through legislation from present and impending danger and distress.
All those entitled to act as members of the Fifty-third Congress are required to take notice of this proclamation and attend at the time and place above stated.
Given under my hand and the seal of the United States, at the city of Washington, on the 30th day of June, A. D. 1893, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and seventeenth.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
By the President:
ALVEY A. ADEE,
 Acting Secretary of State.
