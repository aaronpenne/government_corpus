By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Sound nutrition is important to all Americans, but for the ill it is an essential component in the process of healing and recovery. The dedicated men and women who work in the health care food and nutrition departments of our Nation's hospitals and nursing facilities thus play a very important role in patient care. 
Working in concert with other health care professionals, these individuals provide a variety of patient care services, from nutrition instruction to the preparation and delivery of appetizing and nutritious meals. This week, we salute America's health care food services personnel -- administrators, dieticians, dietary assistants, menu planners, chefs, production workers, and volunteers -- for their professionalism and hard work. 
In recognition of the vital contribution made by health care food service professionals to the well-being of the American people, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 81, has designated the week of October 1 through October 7, 1989, as "National Health Care Food Service Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 Presidnet of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 1, 1989, as National Health Care Food Service Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
