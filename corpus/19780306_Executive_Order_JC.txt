CREATING A BOARD OF INQUIRY To REPORT ON LABOR DISPUTES AFFECTING THE BITUMINOUS COAL INDUSTRY IN THE UNITED STATES 
The existing labor disputes between coal mine operators engaged in the production of bituminous coal in the United States or coal mine contractors engaged in construction work in and around coal mines in the United States and certain of of their employees represented by the United Mine Workers of America and its locals and affiliates have resulted in strikes in a substantial portion of the coal industry. In my judgment these strikes affect a substantial portion of the bituminous coal industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, transportation and transmission among the States and with foreign nations, and will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947, 61 Stat. 155, as amended (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry to inquire into the issues involved in the dispute. I appoint as members of that Board:
John N. Gentry, Chairman
Eva Robins
Carl A. Warns 
The Board shall have the powers and duties set forth in Title II of the Labor Management Relations Act and shall report to me, in accordance with the provisions of the Act, as expeditiously as possible. Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform the functions required of it under the Act.
