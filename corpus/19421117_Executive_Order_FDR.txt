By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 5 of the Act of February 8, 1887 (24 Stat. 388, 389), by the Act of June 21, 1906 (34 Stat. 325, 326), and by the Act of March 2, 1917 (39 Stat. 969, 976), and other applicable provisions of law, it is hereby ordered that the periods of trust applying to Indian lands, whether of a tribal or individual status, which, unless extended, will expire during the calendar year 1943, be, and the same are hereby, extended for a further period of twenty-five years from the date on which any such trust would otherwise expire. 
This order is not intended to apply to any case in which the Congress has specifically reserved to itself authority to extend the period of trust on tribal or individual Indian lands.
