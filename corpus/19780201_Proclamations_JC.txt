By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Good vision is too important to be left to chance. Most of what we learn and do depends upon how well we can see. As one of our most valuable possessions, sight deserves our care and protection. 
By learning the early warning signs of eye disease, practicing eye safety, and having regular eye examinations, we can prevent some of the most common forms of visual impairment and blindness. Many eye disorders can be corrected or alleviated with prompt professional care. By wearing protective eyeglasses or safety goggles in potentially hazardous situations on the job or at home, we can prevent many eye injuries. Regular eye examinations may also detect early signs of other serious health problems, such as diabetes or high blood pressure, long before symptoms appear. 
To increase awareness of the importance of good vision and of ways to protect it, the Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963 (77 Stat. 629, 36 U.S.C. 169a), has requested the President to proclaim the first week of March of each year as Save Your Vision Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning March 5, 1978, as Save Your Vision Week. I urge all Americans to observe this period by learning what they can do to take care of their eyes and by practicing a few simple precautions to protect their sight. I invite the vision care professionals, the communications media, educators, and all public and private organizations which support sight conservation to participate in activities which will inform all Americans about the importance of eye care and encourage them to take steps to protect their vision. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
