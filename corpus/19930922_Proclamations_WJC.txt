A Proclamation
 
Millions of Americans with disabilities are able to achieve independence and lead active, productive lives with the assistance of rehabilitation therapy. Estimates indicate that half of the Nation's population will at some point in their lives need assistance in overcoming some form of physical, mental, emotional, or social disability. "National Rehabilitation Week" seeks to recognize not only the individuals who have learned to cope with their disabilities but also the dedicated health care professionals who have provided assistance through research, education, and therapy.
In tribute to these individuals and their many contributions to our society, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 50, has designated the periods beginning September 19 and ending September 25, 1993, and beginning September 18 and ending September 24, 1994, as National Rehabilitation Week, and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of these weeks.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the periods beginning September 19, 1993, and ending September 25, 1993, and beginning September 18, 1994, and ending September 24, 1994, as National Rehabilitation Week. I call upon all Americans to observe these weeks with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities as an expression of their support.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
