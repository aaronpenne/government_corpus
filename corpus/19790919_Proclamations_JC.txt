By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
This year marks the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Meals on Wheels programs which make nutritious food available to aged and ailing persons in their homes. Since 1954, thousands of volunteers in these programs have made it possible for many of the Nation's elderly to reside at home rather than in institutions and to live healthier, happier and more independent lives. 
In recognition of the outstanding contributions of these volunteers, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 367, has designated the week beginning September 16, 1979, as National Meals on Wheels Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of September 16 through September 22, 1979, as National Meals on Wheels Week. 
In accord with the congressional resolution, I invite the Governors of the several States, the chief officials of local governments and the people of the United States to observe this period with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this nineteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
