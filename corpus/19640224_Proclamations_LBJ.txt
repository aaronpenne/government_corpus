A Proclamation
 
Notwithstanding the fact that hundreds of thousands of volunteer leaders and members of rural organizations actively participate in community, State, and national safety programs which have proved effective in reducing the number and rate of accidents among farm residents, accidents still cause thousands of deaths and nearly a million disabling injuries to farm people each year. This loss of human and economic resources causes a significant adverse impact upon the economy of the entire Nation and must be viewed as a matter of national concern. 
I feel that the many public-spirited persons responsible for past and present farm safety efforts should be commended for their notable achievements and that these efforts should be given renewed public recognition and support. In addition, I urge that vigorous new efforts be made to eradicate, insofar as feasible, all of the reasonably foreseeable causes of farm and rural accidents. Accomplishment of that objective should be the goal of National Farm Safety Week, 1964. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call on the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 19, 1964, as National Farm Safety Week; and I urge all persons and organizations, particularly those working in agriculture, to unite in a strong and purposeful effort to reduce farm, home, and rural highway accidents to an irreducible minimum. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
