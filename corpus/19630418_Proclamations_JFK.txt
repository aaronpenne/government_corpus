A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 there are now more than seventeen million persons aged sixty-five and over in our population, and this number is expected to increase to twenty-four million by 1980; and 
Whereas
 this large segment of our population represents a great national resource of skills, wisdom, and experience upon which much of our Nation's progress has been built and which continues to enrich our daily lives and to provide counsel and leadership; and 
Whereas
 all persons reaching their later years should have opportunity to share fully in the benefits of our advances in economic wealth, science, technology, and culture; and 
Whereas
 all informational and educational means should be used to foster an environment in which our senior citizens can gain this opportunity and can lead useful and satisfying lives, consistent with their capacities; and 
Whereas
 the Federal Government should provide leadership, encouragement, and assistance to the States, communities, and voluntary organizations in utilizing the potentials of our elder citizens: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of May 1963 as Senior Citizens Month; and I urge all persons and public and private organizations to cooperate in its observance by increasing community awareness of the problems faced by older men and women, strengthening services and opportunities to meet their special needs, giving recognition to their past and present contributions, and making this special month the beginning of continuing interest and activity on their behalf. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Governor of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Commissioners of the District of Columbia, and appropriate officials in other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to join in the observance of Senior Citizens Month. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 18th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
