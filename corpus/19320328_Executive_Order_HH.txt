In order to avoid the confusion arising from the fact that one of the several national forests in the State of Colorado bears the name of that State, it is hereby ordered that the name of the "Colorado National Forest," as defined by proclamation of June 12, 1917 (40 Stat. 1671), and subsequently modified by acts of Congress, be changed to "Roosevelt National Forest" in honor of Theodore Roosevelt, twenty-sixth President of the United States.
