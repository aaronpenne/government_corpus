A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 international trade provides each participating nation with the products of the resources and skills of other nations as well as a market for its own products; and
Whereas
 the expansion of import and export trade improves standards of living and encourages full employment of labor and productive facilities, thus promoting prosperity and fostering peace among nations; and
Whereas
 it is the established policy of this country to secure the removal of unnecessary trade restrictions and discriminations through international agreement, as exemplified by the reciprocal-trade-agreements program, and by participation in the United Nations Conference on Trade and Employment held at Havana for the establishment of an International Trade Organization; and
Whereas
 greater emphasis should be given to the importance of world trade to this Nation and to the significance of such trade in bringing about international stability and an enduring peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the nation to observe the week commencing May 16, 1948, as World Trade Week; and I invite the appropriate officials of the several States, Territories, and possessions of the United States, as well as the municipalities and other political subdivisions of the country, to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge trade associations, business establishments, clubs, educational institutions, civic groups, and other organizations, and the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with ceremonies, displays, exhibits, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 24th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-second.
HARRY S. TRUMAN
