A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, by a joint resolution, approved by the President on December 11, 1941, the Congress of the United States formally declared a state of war to exist between the United States and the Government of Germany (55 Stat. 796); and 
Whereas
 on December 31, 1946, the President proclaimed the cessation of hostilities of World War II; and 
Whereas
 it has been and continues to be the policy of the United States to bring about the conclusion of a treaty of peace with the government of a united and free Germany, but efforts to this end have been frustrated and made impossible for the time being by the policy of the Soviet Government; and 
Whereas
 it has nevertheless been considered desirable to bring the existing state of war with Germany to a close and to remove Germany from its present enemy status, thus eliminating certain disabilities affecting German nationals; and 
Whereas
 the rights, privileges, and status of the United States and the other occupation powers in Germany, and the rights and privileges of the United States and its nationals to which it or they have become entitled as a result of the war, as well as the right to exercise or enforce the same, derive from the conquest of Germany and the assumption of supreme authority by the Allies and are not affected by the termination of the state of war; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States by a joint resolution, approved October 19, 1951 (Public Law 181, 82d Congress), has resolved that the state of war declared to exist between the United States and the Government of Germany is terminated and that such termination shall take effect on the date of enactment of such resolution: 
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to such joint resolution, do proclaim that the state of war between the United States and the Government of Germany declared by the joint resolution of Congress approved December 11, 1941 was terminated on October 19, 1951. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
