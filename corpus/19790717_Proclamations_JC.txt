By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Ten years ago this week, the Apollo astronauts changed forever, for all humanity, our concept of the universe and our relation to it. Their electrifying landing on the Moon?that "giant leap" to the surface of another world?was an unparalleled triumph of determination and technological genius. It epitomized the strength and the potential of the American people. 
During ten years since, space has become part of our daily lives. We use it for essential communications and for monitoring our environment. Nationally and internationally, the exploration and use of space hold even greater promise in the future for the wiser management of our planetary resources, for the expansion of knowledge, and for the development of civilization. 
In recognition of this triumph, the Congress, by joint resolution (H.J. Res. 353), has requested that the period of July 16 through 24, 1979, be designated as "United States Space Observance." 
As we face new challenges as a nation-notably the challenge of achieving energy security?let us reflect upon the courage of the Apollo astronauts, and their predecessors in the Mercury and Gemini programs. And let us take courage and inspiration from the success of America's effort to land the first men on the Earth's Moon and return them safely. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of July 16 through July 24, 1979, as "United States Space Observance." In accord with the congressional resolution, I call upon the people of the United States to observe this period with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
