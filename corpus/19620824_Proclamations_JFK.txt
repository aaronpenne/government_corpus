A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our handicapped workers have contributed immeasurably to the strength of our Nation through their productive capacity; and 
Whereas
 our expanding economy demands effective and ever-enlarging utilization of our total manpower, suitably placed according to individual skills and talents; and 
Whereas
 the physically and mentally handicapped, through increased emphasis on rehabilitation and training to prepare them for occupations commensurate with their abilities, stand ready to assume an even greater share in our social and economic progress; and 
Whereas
 their readiness to assume this greater role can be translated into action by acquainting more employers and the public generally with the policy of giving full consideration to handicapped persons in employment, promotion, reassignment and retention; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), has designated the first week in October of each year as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week and has requested the President to issue a suitable proclamation each year: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 7, 1962, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on Employment of the Handicapped in furthering equal employment opportunity for the handicapped. 
I also call upon the Governors of States, mayors of municipalities, Federal and other public officials, leaders of industry and labor, and other interested individuals and organizations to take part in this observance. I particularly urge employers to renew their efforts to give the handicapped equal consideration with others similarly qualified for employment; and I request all our people to follow the American tradition of helping others to help themselves by assisting handicapped persons to achieve economic independence and active participation in the total life of the national community. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-fourth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State
