A Proclamation
 
For more than 4 decades, the National School Lunch Program has helped to promote the health and well-being of the Nation's schoolchildren. Since 1946, the cooperative efforts of State governments and local communities have brought needed Federal food assistance to children throughout the United States. Each day, more than 22 million students in over 90,000 schools receive nutritious, well-balanced lunches through this effective program. 
Parents, teachers, school officials, community leaders, food service specialists, and the students themselves have all played important roles in supporting the program and contributing to its improvement. National School Lunch Week provides all of us with the opportunity to acknowledge their efforts, as well as the vision and concern of the many persons associated with the program throughout the years. Their dedication and cooperation have been vital to the program's success. 
By joint resolution approved October 9, 1962 (Public Law 87-780), the Congress designated the week beginning on the second Sunday of October in each year as "National School Lunch Week" and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that week. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning October 8, 1989, as National School Lunch Week, and I call upon all Americans to recognize those individuals at the State and local levels whose efforts contribute so much to the success of this valuable program. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
