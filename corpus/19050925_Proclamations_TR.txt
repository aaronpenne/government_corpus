By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 it is provided by section twenty-four of the Act of Congress, approved March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," "That the President of the United States may, from time to time, set apart and reserve, in any State or Territory having public land bearing forests, in any part of the public lands wholly or in part covered with timber or undergrowth, whether of commercial value or not, as public reservations, and the President shall, by public proclamation, declare the establishment of such reservations and the limits thereof";
And Whereas,
 the public lands in the State of Utah, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and it appears that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving said lands as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power in me vested by section twenty-four of the aforesaid Act of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that there are hereby reserved from entry or settlement and set apart as a Public Reservation all those certain tracts, pieces or parcels of land lying and being situate in the State of Utah, and within the boundaries particularly described as follows:
Beginning at the north-east corner of Section seventeen (17), Township thirty-eight (38) South, Range thirteen (13) West, Salt Lake Meridian, Utah; thence southerly to the south-east corner of Section thirty-two (32), said township; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Township thirty-nine (39) South, Range thirteen (13) West; thence southerly to the south-east corner of said township; thence westerly to the north-east corner of Section four (4), Township forty (40) South, Range thirteen (13) West; thence southerly to the south-east corner of Section nine (9), said township; thence westerly to the south-west corner of Section seven (7), said township; thence southerly to the south-east corner of Township forty (40) South, Range fourteen (14) West; thence westerly along the Eighth (8th) Standard Parallel South, allowing for the proper offset, to the south-west corner of Township forty (40) South, Range sixteen (16) West; thence northerly to the north-west corner of said township; thence westerly to the boundary line between the States of Nevada and Utah; thence northerly along said state boundary line to the township line between Townships thirty-six (36) and thirty-seven (37) South; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Township thirty-seven (37) South, Range nineteen (19) West; thence southerly to the north-west corner of Section nineteen (19), Township thirty-seven (37) South, Range eighteen (18) West; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section twenty-four Township thirty-seven (37) South, Range sixteen (16) West; thence southerly to the south-westcornerof Township thirty-seven (37) South, Range fifteen (15) West; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Township thirty-eight (38) South, Range fourteen (14) West; thence southerly to the north-west corner of Section eighteen (18), Township thirty-eight (38) South, Range thirteen (13) West; thence easterly to the north-east corner of Section seventeen (17), said township, the place of beginning; such of the above-named corners as have not been established by the official surveys being intended to be located at the points where such corners would fall in projecting the surveys in the directions indicated without allowing for any irregularities which may occur in actually extending the surveys;
Excepting from the force and effect of this proclamation all lands which may have been, prior to the date hereof, embraced in any legal entry or covered by any lawful filing duly of record in the proper United States Land Office, or upon which any valid settlement has been made pursuant to law, and the statutory period within which to make entry or filing of record has not expired:
 Provided
 , that this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved in this proclamation.
The reservation hereby established shall be known as the Dixie Forest Reserve.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 25th day of September, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and five, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirtieth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
