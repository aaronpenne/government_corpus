By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1937, approved June 29, 1937 (50 Stat. 352), it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. There is hereby established a revolving fund, not to exceed in the aggregate $25,000,000, of such amounts as may be transferred thereto from time to time by the Administrator of the Works Progress Administration from funds allocated to that Administration for the prosecution of non-Federal projects under the Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1937. This fund is to be known as the 'Emergency Relief, Works Progress Administration, Supply Fund, 1938', hereinafter referred to as 'the fund'.
2. The Administrator of the Works Progress Administration is authorized to promulgate, with the approval of the President, the administrative regulations necessary to accomplish the purposes of this Executive Order. Such regulations and the operations of the fund shall, however, be subject to and not inconsistent with the provisions of Section II(A) of Executive Order No. 7034, dated May 6, 1935 (as continued by Executive Order No. 7396, dated June 22, 1936, and Executive Order No. 7649, dated June 29, 1937) and regulations issued pursuant thereto, and of section 1 of Executive Order No. 6166, dated June 10, 1933.

4. Reimbursement shall be made to the fund under regulations issued in accordance with paragraph 2 on statements prepared by the State Works Progress Administrations of the value of materials, supplies, equipment, and tools issued for use on any approved non-Federal or Federal projects of the Works Progress Administration or the National Youth Administration. Such statements shall also include a monthly proration of operating costs against projects chargeable therewith. Such reimbursements shall be made at least monthly through checks drawn by the State Disbursing Officers of the United States Treasury Department and shall be immediately credited to the fund, for use in accordance with the purposes thereof.
5. Under regulations prescribed by the Administrator, the fund shall be charged with the value of all materials, supplies, equipment, and tools which are not required for the completion of any project. The amounts so charged shall be paid from the fund by the State Disbursing Officers of the United States Treasury Department upon statements prepared by the State Works Progress Administrations, the amounts so paid to be immediately deposited to the credit of either Appropriation Symbol 465800, 'Emergency Relief, Works Progress Administration (Non-Federal Projects, Approved Prior to June 30, 1937) 1938', or to the official project and appropriation from which the transfer is made, as determined in accordance with administrative regulations. Such reimbursements shall remain available to the Works Progress Administration.
6. A report shall be submitted to the President by the Administrator of the Works Progress Administration showing the amounts of the inventory remaining charged to the fund as of June 30, 1938, with respect to each State, classified according to major categories of materials, supplies, tools, and equipment.
