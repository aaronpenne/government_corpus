A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 it is recognized that our children embody our most cherished hopes:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the first day of May of this year as Child Health Day; and I call upon the people of each community of the United States, and all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare, to consider upon that day how, in the coming year, they may carry out the objectives of the Midcentury White House Conference on Children and Youth, held last year, to the end that all our children may grow in physical, mental, and emotional health, with faith in God and in the dignity of man.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
