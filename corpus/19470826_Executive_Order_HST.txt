By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the War Department Civil Appropriation Act, 1948 (Public Law 296, 80th Congress), section 104 of the Navy Department Appropriation Act, 1948 (Public Law 202, 80th Congress), and section 5 of the Military Appropriation Act, 1948 (Public Law 267, 80th Congress), relating to certain kinds of employment in the Canal Zone, and deeming such course to be in the public interest, I hereby suspend, from and including the effective dates of the said Acts, compliance with the provisions of the said sections during the continuance of any of the wars in which the United States is now engaged or of the present national emergency.
Findings such action necessary because of a shortage of housing, I hereby suspend, for the fiscal year 1948, the application of those portions of the cited sections of the respective Acts which require the employment of citizens of the Republic of Panama or of the United States in skilled, technical, clerical, administrative executive, or supervisory positions.
