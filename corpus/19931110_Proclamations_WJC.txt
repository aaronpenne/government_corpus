By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
American women have served with distinction and courage in every overseas combat theater of conflict since World War I. Some have been wounded in the line of duty, and others have given their lives for our country, but all have contributed tremendously to the success of America's Armed Forces. Bringing their talent, skill, and vision to a variety of occupations within each of the service branches, women have made an everlasting mark on the military history of the United States.
The loyalty and the sacrifices of the women who have served our country merit the respect and admiration of all of us. It is fitting then that we set aside a special time to honor these veterans, to salute them for their tireless devotion to duty while in uniform and for their patriotism and commitment to democratic ideals in civilian life.
The Vietnam Women's Memorial is a monument dedicated to the many women who volunteered to serve in the Armed Forces during the Vietnam era. Appropriately, it recognizes the living as well as those who died. It is part of the important ongoing process of healing, both for veterans and for our country as a whole. It is a remembrance of the brave and compassionate service that is so worthy of our esteem.
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, do hereby proclaim the week of November 7, 1993, as National Women Veterans Recognition Week, and I encourage all Americans to join in acknowledging the contributions and sacrifices of these veterans.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighteenth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
