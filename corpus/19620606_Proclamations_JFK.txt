A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American flag symbolizes the strength, honor, ideals, and national purposes of our Nation; and 
Whereas
 under this flag people of diverse origins and religious beliefs have found surcease from oppression and an opportunity for a better life; and 
Whereas
 the Stars and Stripes have always inspired our men to deeds of valor and sacrifice in safeguarding our heritage and advancing the cause of world freedom; and 
Whereas
 in these challenging times this generation of Americans is once again called upon to muster the courage, steadfastness, and vigilance needed to protect the principles symbolized by our flag; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day in commemoration of the adoption of the flag of the United States by the Continental Congress on June 14, 1777, and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its observance: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on Thursday, June 14, 1962; and I call upon the people to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies designed to honor our national emblem. 
I also urge our citizens to pause during this day to rededicate themselves to the principles and ideals for which our flag stands. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
