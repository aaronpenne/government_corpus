By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes of the United States, and particularly by the Stabilization Act of 1942, as amended, and for the purpose of further effecting an orderly transition from war to a peace-time economy, it is hereby ordered as follows:
All controls heretofore in effect stabilizing wages and salaries pursuant to the provisions of the Stabilization Act of 1942, as amended, including any Executive order or regulation issued thereunder, are hereby terminated; except that as to offenses committed, or right or liability incurred, prior to the date hereof, the provisions of such Executive orders and regulations shall be treated as still remaining in force for the purpose of sustaining any proper suit, action, or prosecution with respect to any such right, liability, or offense.
