A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the American Merchant Marine has again displayed, during the past year, its ability to support the military forces of our Nation by furnishing supplies to the fighting men engaged in the Korean hostilities; and
Whereas
 the American Merchant Marine has continued to promote international trade and travel while serving the defense and security requirements of the Nation; and
Whereas
 present world conditions require a constant state of readiness on the part of the American Merchant Marine in order that it may assist, along with all other branches of our Nation's industry and economy, in meeting the threat of aggression to our democracy; and
Whereas
 the Congress by joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), took cognizance of the historic fact that "on May 22, 1819, the steamship The Savannah set sail from Savannah, Georgica, on the first successful transoceanic voyage under steam propulsion", and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually calling for the observance of May 22 as National Maritime Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe Tuesday, May 22, 1951, as National Maritime Day by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes or other suitable places, and direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings on that day. I also request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on May 22, 1951, in honor of our Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth.
