A Proclamation
 
To the People of the United States:
 
It becomes my sad duty to announce officially the death of William Howard Taft, which occurred at his home in the City of Washington, on the eighth day of March, nineteen hundred and thirty, at five-fifteen o'clock in the afternoon.
Mr. Taft's service to our country has been of rare distinction, and was marked by a purity of patriotism, a lofty disinterestedness, and a devotion to the best interests of the Nation that deserve and will ever command the grateful memory of his countrymen. His career was almost unique in the wide range of official duty: as Judge, Solicitor General, Governor General of the Philippines, Secretary of War, President of the United States, and finally Chief Justice.
His private life was characterized by a simplicity of virtue that won for him a place in the affection of his fellow countrymen rarely equaled by any man. In public and in private life he set a shining example, and his death will be mourned throughout the land.
As an expression of the public sorrow, it is ordered that the flags of the White House and of the several departmental buildings be displayed at half staff for a period of thirty days, and that suitable military and naval honors under orders of the Secretary of War and the Secretary of the Navy may be rendered on the day of the funeral.
Done
 at the City of Washington this eighth day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and thirty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and fifty-fourth.
HERBERT HOOVER
 By the President:
 WILBUR J. CARR
 Acting Secretary of State.
