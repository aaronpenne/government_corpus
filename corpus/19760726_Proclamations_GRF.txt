By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
In this extraordinary year which holds so much significance for the citizens of the United States, we render especial honor to those intrepid explorers who reached our land so long ago and prepared the way for the many who followed to settle this proud nation. 
Although we celebrate the 200th year of our nationhood this year, our history stretches back much further to that Norseman of vision and courage, Leif Erikson. In a dark and superstitious age, he sailed far beyond the limits anyone else had dared, to touch our shores and to weave his brave exploit into our historical fabric. He has left for us all a standard by which to set our sails as we move into a new century of existence. 
In a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849, 36 U.S.C. 169c), the Congress authorized the President to proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day 
NOW, THEREFORE, I, GERALD R. FOLD, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, October 9, 1976, as Leif Erikson Day and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred first. 
GERALD R. FORD
