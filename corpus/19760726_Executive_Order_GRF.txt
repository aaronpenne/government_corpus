Harold Council, a member of the Mississippi River Commission, will become subject to mandatory retirement for age as of July 31, 1976, under the provisions of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, unless exempted by Executive order. 
In my judgment, the public interest requires that Harold Council be exempted from such mandatory retirement. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by subsection (c) of section 8335 of title 5 of the United States Code, I hereby exempt Harold Council from mandatory retirement until July 31, 1977.
