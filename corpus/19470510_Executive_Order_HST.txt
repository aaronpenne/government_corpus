By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 18 of the Pay Readjustment Act of 1942, as amended (37 U.S.C., Supp. V, 118), paragraph 2 of Executive Order No. 9460 of August 7, 1944, prescribing regulations relating to glider flights by personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard, is hereby amended to read as follows:
"2. Personnel of the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, and Coast Guard who are qualified as glider personnel under such regulations as the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy may severally prescribe, or who are undergoing training for such qualification, and who are required by competent authority to participate regularly and frequently in glider flights, shall be required to perform one or more flight without regard to duration thereof during any three consecutive calendar months: Provided, That whenever, under authority conferred by the Secretary of War or the Secretary of the Navy, the commanding officer of any officer, warrant officer, nurse, or enlisted man who has been required by orders of competent authority to participate in regular and frequent glider flights certifies that on account of the absence or inadequacy of glider equipment or towing aircraft or other means of propulsion, or on account of military operations of the particular command under combat conditions, such officer, warrant officer, nurse, or enlisted man was unable to perform the glider flights required by this paragraph, such officer, warrant officer, nurse, or enlisted man may comply with the requirements herein prescribed by performing four or more glider flights without regard to the duration thereof during a period of twelve consecutive calendar months, and such requirements for any particular period may be met at any time during such period: And provided further, That any officer, warrant officer, nurse, or enlisted man who has been required to participate regularly and frequently in glider flights by orders of competent authority and who as a result of such orders has participated regularly and frequently in glider flights, as defined in this order, and who subsequently becomes incapacitated for glider flights by reason of an aviation accident shall not be required to perform such glider flights during such incapacity for a period not to exceed three months following the date of such accident.
This order shall become effective July 1, 1947.
