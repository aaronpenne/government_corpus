WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between the Union Carbide Corporation, a New York Corporation, and certain of its employees represented by the United Steelworkers of America, AFL-CIO, and Local Union No. 2958 thereof, involving the Stellite Division plant of Union Carbide Corporation located at Kokomo, Indiana; and
WHEREAS, such dispute has resulted in a strike which will, in my opinion, if permitted to continue, affect a substantial part of the military aircraft engine industry, which industry is engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States or with foreign nations, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce, and which strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national safety:
Now THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 155; 29 'U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of Mr. Laurence E. Seibel, Chairman, Mr. Frank J. Dugan and Mr. Garth L. Mangum, whom I appoint to inquire into the issues involved in this dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of such Act on or before December 20, 1966.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such Act.
