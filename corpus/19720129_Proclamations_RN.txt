A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in him by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, the President, by Proclamations No. 2761A of December 16, 1947, No. 2929 of June 2, 1951, and No. 3140 of June 13, 1956 (61 Stat. (pt. 2) 1103, 65 Stat. c12, and 70 Stat. c33), proclaimed such modifications of existing duties as were found to be required or appropriate to carry out trade agreements into which he had entered;
2. 
Whereas
 among the proclaimed modifications were modifications in the rates of duty on glass of the kinds which are now provided for in items 542.11 through 542.98 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter referred to as "sheet glass");
3. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 351 (a) (1) of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (hereinafter "TEA") (19 U.S.C. 1981 (a) (1)) and in accordance with Article XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (hereinafter "GATT") (61 Stat. (pt. 5) A58; 8 UST (pt. 2) 1786), the President by Proclamation No. 3967 of February 27, 1970 (35 F.R. 3975), proclaimed increased duties on imports of sheet glass in Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (hereinafter "TSUS") which duties are scheduled to be reduced on January 31, 1972;
4. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 301(b) (1) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1901(b) (1)) the Tariff Commission on August 16, 1971, instituted an investigation, the report to the President on which is to be made not later than January 31, 1972, to determine whether glass of the kinds provided for in items 541.11 through 541.31, 542.11 through 542.98, 543.11 through 543.69 and 544.31 through 544.32 of the TSUS are, as a result in major part of concessions granted thereon under trade agreements, being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to cause, or threaten to cause, serious injury to the domestic industry producing like or directly competitive products;
5. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 351 (c) (2) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1981(c) (2)), after taking into account advice received from the Tariff Commission under section 351(d) (3) of the TEA (19 U.S.C. 1981(d) (3)) and after seeking advice of the Secretaries of Commerce and Labor, I have determined that the extension as hereinafter proclaimed of the increased duties currently in effect on imports of sheet glass provided for in items 923.31 through 923.75 of the TSUS from January 31, 1972 to April 30, 1972 is in the national interest;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 351(c) (2) of the TEA, do proclaim that-
1. The tariff concessions on sheet glass in Part I of Schedule XX to the GATT shall be modified in part as provided for in paragraph 2 below;
2. Effective with respect to items entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period commencing on the date of this proclamation and terminating at the close of January 31, 1974, so much of Subpart A of Part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS as follows item 922.50 and precedes item 924.00 is modified to read as set out in the annex to this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
