A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 3160 of September 28, 1956 (71 Stat. C12), as amended by Proclamation No. 3225 of March 7, 1958 (3 CFR, 1958 Supp., p. 19), and by Proclamation No. 3285 of April 21, 1959 (24 F.R. 3221), the President announced the invocation by the Government of the United States of America of the reservation contained in the note to item 1108 in Part I of Schedule XX annexed to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat. (pt. 5) All, Al274), and proclaimed that the ad valorem part of the rate applicable to fabrics described in item 1108 or 1109 (a) in Part I of Schedule XX to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat. (pt. 5) Al274), or in item 1109 (a) in Part I of Schedule XX to the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (3 UST (pt. 1) 615, 1186), entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in excess of certain quantities would be either 30 per centum or 45 per centum, depending on the classification of such fabrics; and
2. 
Whereas
 I find that as of January 1, 1959, it will be appropriate to carry out the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade that the ad valorem part of the rate be 30 per centum ad valorem in the case of any of the fabrics described in item 1108 or 1109(a) in Part I of Schedule XX to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or in item 1109(a) in Part I of Schedule XX to the Torquay Protocol to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which are described in subparagraph (a) of the seventh recital of the proclamation of September 28, 1956, as amended by the proclamations of March 7, 1958, and April 21, 1959, and as further amended by this proclamation:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 3(a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1955 (69 Stat. 162; 19 U.S.C. 1351(a), Supp. V), and by section 3(a) of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1958 (72 Stat. 673; Public Law 85-686, sec. 3(a)), do hereby proclaim that, except insofar as this would result in the assessment on any article entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption prior to the date of this proclamation of a higher duty than would have been assessed thereon under the Proclamation of April 21, 1959, the seventh recital of the proclamation of September 28, 1956, as amended by the proclamations of March 7, 1958, and April 21, 1959, is hereby further amended to read as follows:
"7. 
Whereas
 I find that following December 31, 1958, and until otherwise proclaimed by the President, it will be appropriate to carry out the trade agreements specified in the first and third recitals of this proclamation that the ad valorem part of the rate be as set forth below in the case of the fabrics described in item 1108 or 1109(a) in Part I of Schedule XX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade set forth in the second recital hereof, or in item 1109(a) in Part I of Schedule XX to the Torquay Protocol set forth in the fourth recital hereof (except in each case articles dutiable at rates applicable to such fabrics by virtue of any provision of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, other than paragraph 1108 or 1109(a)), entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any calendar year after that total aggregate quantity by weight of such fabrics which shall have been notified by the President to the Secretary of the Treasury, and published in the FEDERAL REGISTER (which quantity the President shall have found to be not less than 5 per centum of the average annual production in the United States during the three immediately preceding calendar years of fabrics similar to such fabrics), has been so entered or withdrawn during such calendar year:
"(a) 30 per centum ad valorem in the case of any such fabrics which are:
