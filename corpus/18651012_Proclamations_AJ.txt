A Proclamation
 
Whereas by a proclamation of the 5th day of July, 1864, the President of the United States, when the civil war was flagrant and when combinations were in progress in Kentucky for the purpose of inciting insurgent raids into that State, directed that the proclamation suspending the privilege of the writ of
 habeas corpus
 should be made effectual in Kentucky and that martial law should be established there and continue until said proclamation should be revoked or modified; and
Whereas since then the danger from insurgent raids into Kentucky has substantially passed away:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution, do hereby declare that the said proclamation of the 5th day of July, 1864, shall be, and is hereby, modified in so far that martial law shall be no longer in force in Kentucky from and after the date hereof.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 12th day of October, A.D. 1865, and of the Independence of the United States the ninetieth.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
By the President:
W. HUNTER,
 Acting-Secretary of State.
