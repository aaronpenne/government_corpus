By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), limitations have been imposed by Presidential_ proclamations on the quantities of certain dairy products which may be imported into the United States in any quota year; and
Whereas
 the import restrictions proclaimed pursuant to said section 22 are set forth in part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has reported to me that he believes that additional quantities of butter, butter substitutes containing butterfat and butter oil provided for in items 950.05 and 950.06 of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) may be entered for a temporary period without rendering or tending to render ineffective, or materially interfering with, the price support program now conducted by the Department of Agriculture for milk or reducing substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and
Whereas
, under the authority of section 22, I have requested the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation with respect to this matter; and
Whereas
 the Secretary of Agriculture has determined and reported to me that a condition exists with respect to such articles provided for in items 950.05 and 950.06 of the TSUS which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitation imposed on such articles should be increased during the period ending December 31, 1973, without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the entry during the period ending December 31, 1973, of additional quantities of 56,000,000 pounds of the articles provided for in item 950.05 of the TSUS and 22,600,000 pounds of the articles provided for in item 950.06 of the TSUS will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the price support program which is being undertaken by the Department of Agriculture for milk and will not reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from domestic milk; and that a condition exists which requires emergency treatment and that the quantitative limitations imposed on such articles should be increased during such period without awaiting the recommendations of the United States Tariff Commission with respect to such action;
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me as President, and in conformity with the provisions of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, and the Tariff Classification Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that headnote 3 (a) of part 3 of the Appendix to the Tariff Schedules of the United States is temporarily amended by adding a new subdivision as follows:
