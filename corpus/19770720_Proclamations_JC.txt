By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Since 1959 the Congress, by joint resolution (73 Stat. 212), has authorized and requested the President to designate the third week in July as Captive Nations Week. 
Our own country was established on a profound belief in national self-determination. Throughout our history we have sought to give meaning to this principle and to our belief in liberty and human rights. 
In recognition of this commitment, 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 17, 1977, as Captive Nations Week. 
I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, demonstrating America's support for those who seek national independence, liberty, and human rights. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second. 
JIMMY CARTER
