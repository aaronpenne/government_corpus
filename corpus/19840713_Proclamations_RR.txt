By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United States has long depended upon the ocean for food, transportation, national security, and recreation. Today, the ocean has become even more important to the people of our Nationâ€”as a source of petroleum and minerals and an avenue for foreign trade. In addition, the ocean is a constant source of employment for hundreds of thousands of Americans each year. 
This Nation is the steward of the resources of the ocean. Americans have long cherished the freedom of the coastal regions which border our shores. The ocean is the link between the many countries with which we have shared the discoveries of modern technology in the development of oceanography.
Our increased use of the ocean requires that we work to protect this resource effectively and efficiently. In order to do so, we must educate Americans concerning the role of the ocean in our lives and our responsibility to match increased uses of marine resources with vigilant efforts to preserve the ocean environment for the benefit of future generations. 
In recognition of the importance of expanding public awareness and knowledge of the importance of the ocean and its resources, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 257, has designated July 1, 1984, to July 1, 1985, as the "Year of the Ocean" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event.
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the year July 1, 1984, to July 1, 1985, as the Year of the Ocean. I call upon the people of the United States to observe such celebration with appropriate activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and ninth.
RONALD REAGAN
