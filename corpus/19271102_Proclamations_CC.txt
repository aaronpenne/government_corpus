A Proclamation
Whereas,
 the 11th of November, 1918, marked the cessation of the most destructive, sanguinary and far-reaching war in human annals; and 
Whereas,
 it is fitting that the recurring anniversary of this day should be commemorated with thanksgiving and prayer, and by exercises designed to further the cause of permanent peace through the maintenance of good will and friendly relations between nations; and 
Whereas,
 by concurrent resolution of the Senate and the House of Representatives, in 1926, the President was requested to issue a proclamation for the observance of Armistice Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States of America, in pursuance of the said concurrent resolution, do hereby order that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on November 11, 1927, and do invite the people of the United States to observe the day in schools and churches, and other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies, giving expression to our gratitude that peace exists and to our sincere desire that such amicable relations with all other peoples may continue.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused to be affixed the great seal of the United States.
Done
 at the City of Washington this second day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and fifty-second.
CALVIN COOLIDGE
