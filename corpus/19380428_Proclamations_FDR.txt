A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by Proclamation No. 2092 of August 9, 1934, the United States mints were directed to receive for coinage or for addition to the monetary stocks of the United States silver situated on August 9, 1934, in the continental United States, including the Territory of Alaska; and
Whereas
 such proclamation provides, in part:
"Notice is hereby given that I reserve the right by virtue of the authority vested in me to revoke or modify this Proclamation as the interest of the United States may seem to require."
And Whereas
 I find that the interest of the United States requires the revocation, except as herein provided, of the said proclamation:
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 43 (b) (2), Title III of the act of May 12, 1933, 48 Stat. 52, as amended, and the Silver Purchase Act of 1934 (48 Stat. 1178), and by virtue of all other authority in me vested, do hereby revoke the said Proclamation No. 2092 of August 9, 1934, except as to the provisions thereof relating to settlement for silver received by the United States coinage mints pursuant to Proclamation No. 2067 of December 21, 1933, which provisions shall not be affected by this proclamation.
Notice is hereby given that I reserve the right by virtue of the authority vested in me to revoke or modify this proclamation as the interest of the United States may seem to require.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
