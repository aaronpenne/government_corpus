By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On April 13 of this year the Congress of the United States concluded its deliberations on a joint resolution which recognized the need for this Nation to set aside a special day devoted to recognizing the importance of education in the lives of our citizens. To emphasize its commitment, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating April 18, 1978, as Education Day, U.S.A., and calling for its appropriate observance. I am honored to join with the House of Representatives and the Senate in recognizing this need and privileged to comply with their request.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, April 18, 1978, as Education Day, U.S.A. and I ask all Americans to observe that day in such manner as reflects their commitment to education and their recognition of its importance to the welfare of this Nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
