A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), on October 27, 1960 the President issued Proclamation No. 3378 imposing quantitative limitations on imports of tung oil and tung nuts during each of the three 12-month periods beginning November 1, 1960, November 1, 1961, and November 1, 1962 (3 CFR, 1960 Supp., p. 44) ; 
Whereas
, at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation under the authority of sub-section (d) of the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, to determine whether the circumstances requiring the imposition of the said limitations no longer exist so that the said Proclamation 3378 may therefore be terminated; 
Whereas
 the said Commission has transmitted to me a report of its supplemental investigation and of findings made in connection therewith: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby find and proclaim that the circumstances requiring the said Proclamation No. 3378 no longer exist. Accordingly, I hereby terminate the said proclamation, effective on the day following the date hereof. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE in the City of Washington this first day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
