The Secretary of State, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of section 7(b) of the Act, shall require reimbursement from the United Nations for the expense thereby incurred by the United States whenever personnel or assistance is made available to the United Nations, except that in exceptional circumstances, or when the Secretary of State finds it to be in the national interest, he may, after consultation with the Secretary of Defense, waive, in whole or in part, the requirement of such reimbursement.
3. The Secretary of Defense, in accordance with and subject to the provisions of section 7(a)(1) of the Act, may authorize personnel of the armed forces detailed to the United Nations to accept directly from the United Nations (a) any or all of the allowances or perquisites to which they are entitled under the first proviso of section 7(a)(1) of the Act, and (b) extraordinary expenses and perquisites incident to such detail.
