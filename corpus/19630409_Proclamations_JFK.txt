A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Sir Winston Churchill, a son of America though a subject of Britain, has been throughout his life a firm and steadfast friend of the American people and the American Nation; and 
Whereas
 he has freely offered his hand and his faith in days of adversity as well as triumph; and 
Whereas
 his bravery, charity and valor, both in war and in peace, have been a flame of inspiration in freedom's darkest hour; and 
Whereas
 his life has shown that no adversary can overcome, and no fear can deter, free men in the defense of their freedom; and 
Whereas
 he has expressed with unsurpassed power and splendor the aspirations of peoples everywhere for dignity and freedom; and 
Whereas
 he has by his art as an historian and his judgment as a statesman made the past the servant of the future; 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, under the authority contained in an Act of the 88th Congress, do hereby declare Sir Winston Churchill an honorary citizen of the United States of America. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

GEORGE W. BALL,
