By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The entertainment industry in America today has an enormous ability to inform and educate at the same time that it entertains. This fact is especially well-known to the thirty-six million Americans with disabilities, because they are aware of the concerted efforts being made by the entertainment industry to dispel the unfair stereotypes that still hinder the progress of disabled people in our society. 
One of the most important messages the entertainment industry is delivering to the public is that people with disabilities can live full and rewarding lives. They ask only to be given the same opportunities to compete and achieve as everyone else. To provide them with this opportunity is not only fair, but makes available to society a rich pool of talents and ambitions that would otherwise be lost. 
The entertainment industry deserves to be commended for its role in making these worthy developments possible. Because of the industry's continuing efforts, Americans with disabilities can look forward to brighter futures, filled with the wide variety of opportunities they deserve. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 86, has designated the period from July 25, 1985, through July 31, 1985, as "National Disability in Entertainment Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in honor of this observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of July 25, 1985, through July 31, 1985, as National Disability in Entertainment Week, and I call upon all Americans to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
