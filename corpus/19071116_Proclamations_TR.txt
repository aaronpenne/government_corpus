A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the group of cliff-dwellings, known as the Gila Hot Springs Cliff-Houses, which is situated upon public land in the Mogollon Mountains, within the Gila National Forest, in the Territory of New Mexico, is of exceptional scientific and educational interest, being the best representative of the Cliff-Dwellers' remains of that region, and it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving these ruins as a National Monument, with as much land as may be necessary for the proper protection thereof: 
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the power in me vested by section two of the Act of Congress, approved June eighth, nineteen hundred and six, entitled, "An Act For the preservation of American antiquities," do proclaim that there are hereby reserved from appropriation and use of all kinds under all of the public land laws, subject to all prior valid adverse claims, and set apart as a National Monument, all the tracts of land, in the Territory of New Mexico, known as the Gila Cliff-Dwellings National Monument on the diagram forming a part hereof. 
The reservation made by this proclamation is not intended to prevent the use of the lands for forest purposes under the proclamation establishing the Gila National Forest, but so far as the two reservations are consistent they are equally effective. In all respects in which they may be inconsistent the National Monument hereby established shall be the dominant reservation. 
Warning is hereby given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure or destroy any feature of this National Monument or to locate or settle upon any of the lands reserved by this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
Done
 at the City of Washington this 16th day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and thirty-second. 
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
