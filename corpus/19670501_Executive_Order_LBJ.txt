By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, Executive Order No. 11136 of January 3,1964, is hereby amended to read as follows:
"The consumer's interest is the American interest, for we are all consumers. In filling the needs of our daily lives, we are direct purchasers of two thirds of our total national production.
"The success of our competitive economic system depends on the furtherance of the consumer interest. And it is our free marketplace, working for the benefit of the individual, that has given to the American consumer the highest standard of living the world has ever known.
"The consumer has four very basic rights in that marketplaceâ€”the right to be informed about the products he buys; the right to choose between several varieties of those products; the right to be protected from unsafe products; and the right to be heard in the highest councils of government.
"It is our job to assure the preservation of those rights. To do so, we must have the cooperation of business and industry, as well as of the consumer. They are all integral, interacting, indispensable elements of our economic system. They must have mutual trust, mutual respect, and a mutual dedication to a sound and healthy America.
"Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:
