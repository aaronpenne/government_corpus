A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 January 16, 1963, marks the eightieth anniversary of the signing of the Civil Service Act of 1883; and 
Whereas
 the Civil Service Act has stood the tests of time in providing the excellence in civil service which is required for successful execution of Federal programs and policies which have deep significance to all Americans and all citizens of the free world; and 
Whereas
 the Act of 1883 has been strengthened by subsequent laws, interpretations, and executive actions to create an even more effective and highly qualified Federal work force; and 
Whereas
 the life of every American is touched directly or indirectly every day by the services which Federal public servants perform; and 
Whereas
 public esteem for career civil servants is a prerequisite for attracting well-qualified citizens to compete for Government service, a fact which requires greater public awareness of the value of the merit system, the achievements of Government workers, and the career opportunities offered in Federal service: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to participate in the observance of the eightieth anniversary of the Civil Service Act during the month of January 1963. 
I also call upon the heads of Federal departments and agencies, as well as leaders of industry and labor and members of all public-spirited groups, to arrange appropriate ceremonies in honor of the public services performed by our able and devoted Federal civil servants throughout the country. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. . 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-eighth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State
