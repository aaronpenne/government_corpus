A Proclamation
 
To the People of the United States:
 
Grover Cleveland, President of the United States from 1885 to 1889 and again from 1893 to 1897, died at 8:40 o'clock this morning at his home in Princeton, New Jersey. In his death, the Nation has been deprived of one of its greatest citizens. By profession a lawyer, his chief services to his country were rendered during his long, varied and honorable career in public life. As Mayor of his city, as Governor of his State, and twice as President, he showed signal power as an administrator, coupled with entire devotion to the country's good and the courage that quailed before no hostility when once he was convinced where his duty lay. Since his retirement from the Presidency he has continued well and faithfully to serve his countrymen by the simplicity, dignity and uprightness of his private life.
In testimony of the respect in which his memory is held by the government and people of the United States, I do hereby direct that the flags on the White House and the several departmental buildings be displayed at half-staff for a period of thirty days; and that suitable military and naval honors, under the orders of the Secretaries of War and of the Navy, be rendered on the day of the funeral.
Done
 this twenty-fourth day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and eight and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and thirty-second.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT.
By the President:
ALVEY A. ADEE,
 Acting Secretary of State
