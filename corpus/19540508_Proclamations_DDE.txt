A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it is essential for the peace and security of the free world that our Nation and its friends throughout the world maintain and increase their individual and combined economic strength; and
Whereas
 the growth and prosperity of the nations of the free world depend to a significant degree upon the continued expansion of the exchange of their goods and services in world markets; and
Whereas
 mutual economic advantages accrue to buyer and seller, to producer and consumer, and to individuals and nations through the exchange of goods and services in world trade:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 16, 1954, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the several States, Territories, possessions, and municipalities of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 8th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
