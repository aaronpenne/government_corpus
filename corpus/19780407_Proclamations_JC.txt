A Proclamation
 
As President of the United States of America, acting through my representatives, I entered into the negotiation of an agreement on trade relations between the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic with representatives of the Hungarian People's Republic; 
The negotiations were conducted in accordance with the requirements of the Trade Act of 1974 (P.L. 93-618, January 3, 1975; 88 Stat. 1978) ("the Act"); 
An "Agreement on Trade Relations between the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic," in English and Hungarian, was signed on March 17, 1978, by representatives of the two Governments, and is annexed to this Proclamation; 
The Agreement conforms to the requirements relating to bilateral commercial agreements specified in Section 405 (b) of the Act; 
Article XI of the Agreement provides that it shall enter into force on the date of exchange of written notices of acceptance by the Governments of the United States of America and the Hungarian People's Republic; and 
Section 405 (c) of the Act provides that a bilateral commercial agreement and a proclamation implementing such agreement shall take effect only if approved by the Congress; 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, proclaim as follows: 
(1) This Proclamation shall become effective, said Agreement shall enter into force according to its terms, and nondiscriminatory treatment shall be extended to the products of the Hungarian People's Republic in accordance with the terms of the said Agreement, on the date of exchange of written notices of acceptance in accordance with Article XI of the said Agreement; and 
(2) General Headnote 3(e) of the Tariff Schedules of the United States is amended by deleting therefrom "Hungary" as of the effective date of this proclamation and a notice thereof shall be published in the FEDERAL REGISTER promptly thereafter. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have signed this Proclamation this seventh day of April, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred second.
