By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Since children are this Nation's most valuable asset, nothing is more important than fostering their development and protecting them from avoidable harm. 
It is deeply disturbing that accidental injury is the leading cause of death among children in the United States. More than 10,000 children die each year and thousands more are left with physical damage as a result of accidents. 
Experts predict that the incidence of accidental deaths among our children can be decreased by 90 percent by preventing accidental injuries and seeking immediate emergency care when needed. Working together, parents, schools, private and voluntary organizations, and government at all levels can bring about a greater public understanding of this problem and of strategies for solving it. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 344, has designated the week beginning June 8, 1986, as "National Children's Accident Prevention Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 8, 1986, as National Children's Accident Prevention Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
