By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
This year marks the tenth anniversary of the Peace Corps, which has sent more than 45,000 volunteers overseas to serve in nearly 70 developing countries.
Few governmental organizations have so inspired and captured the imaginations of Americans both young and old. I therefore take special pleasure in complying with Senate Joint Resolution 29, requesting that the week beginning May 30, 1971, and ending June 5, 1971, be designated as National Peace Corps Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of May 30 through June 5, 1971, as National Peace Corps Week; and I invite the Governors of the States and appropriate local government officials to issue similar proclamations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 28th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
