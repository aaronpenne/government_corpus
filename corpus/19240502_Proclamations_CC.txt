A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 there is located in townships one south, one and two north, ranges twenty-four and twenty-five east of the Boise Meridian, in Butte and Blaine Counties, Idaho, an area which contains a remarkable fissure eruption together with its associated volcanic cones, craters, rifts, lava flows, caves, natural bridges, and other phenomena characteristic of volcanic action which are of unusual scientific value and general interest; and
Whereas,
 this area contains many curious and unusual phenomena of great educational value and has a weird and scenic landscape peculiar to itself; and
Whereas,
 it appears that the public interest would be promoted by reserving these volcanic features as a National Monument, together with as much land as may be needed for the protection thereof.
Now, therefore, I, Calvin Coolidge,
 President of the United States of America, by authority of the power in me vested by section two of the act of Congress entitled, "An Act for the preservation of American antiquities," approved June eight, nineteen hundred and six (34 Stat., 225) do proclaim that there is hereby reserved from all forms of appropriation under the public land laws, subject to all valid existing claims, and set apart as a National Monument all that piece or parcel of land in the Counties of Butte and Blaine, State of Idaho, shown as the Craters of the Moon National Monument upon the diagram hereto annexed and made a part hereof.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all unauthorized persons not to appropriate, injure, destroy or remove any feature of this Monument and not to locate or settle upon any of the lands thereof.
The Director of the National Park Service, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, shall have the supervision, management, and control of this Monument as provided in the act of Congress entitled, "An Act to establish a National Park Service and for other purposes," approved August twenty-fifth, nineteen hundred and sixteen (39 Stat., 535) and Acts additional thereto or amendatory thereof.
In witness thereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 in the City of Washington this 2d day of May in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-four and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-eighth.
