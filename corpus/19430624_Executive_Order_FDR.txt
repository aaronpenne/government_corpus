By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by section 10 of the Pay Readjustment Act of June 16, 1942 (56 Stat. 359, 363), paragraph 5 of Executive Order No. 9226 of August 19, 1942, [FN1] prescribing regulations governing the furnishing of clothing in kind or payment of cash allowances in lieu thereof to enlisted men of the Navy, the Coast Guard, the Naval Reserve, and the Coast Guard Reserve, is hereby amended to read as follows:
'5. (a) Members of the Naval Reserve undergoing flight training leading to a commission shall be entitled to an issue of clothing in kind not to exceed $180 in value. In the event that such members of the Naval Reserve who first enlisted or reported for active duty with pay in this status fail to complete successfully the required training leading to a commission, they shall, upon reclassification to another enlisted status in the Naval Reserve, or upon reenlistment prior to the expiration of three months from the date of discharge in the Navy, the Coast Guard, the Naval Reserve, or the Coast Guard Reserve, be entitled to the applicable cash allowances authorized by paragraph 1 hereof, notwithstanding any other provision of this order.
(b) Members of the Naval Reserve undergoing training, other than flight training, leading to a commission shall be entitled to an issue of clothing in kind not to exceed $15 in value, and, in addition, may be temporarily issued Government-owned clothing not to exceed $120 in value. Temporary members of the Coast Guard Reserve on part time or intermittent active duty may be issued clothing in kind in an amount not to exceed the allowances prescribed in paragraph 1. The allowances in kind prescribed by this subparagraph are in lieu of any cash clothing allowances.'
This order shall take effect as of August 5, 1942.
