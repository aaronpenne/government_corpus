By virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 332 of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1332), it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. In order to assist the President in the exercise of his authority under headnote 3 to schedule 7, part 8, subpart A, of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (79 Stat. 948; 19 U.S.C. 1202), the United States Tariff Commission shall keep under review developments with regard to whiskbrooms of a kind provided for in items 750.26 to 750.28, inclusive, of the tariff schedules, and other brooms of a kind provided for in items 750.29 to 750.31, inclusive, of such schedules, and shall annually report to the President, as early as practicable in each calendar year, its judgment as to the estimated annual consumption of each such kind of brooms during the immediately preceding calendar year, together with the basis therefor. The first report by the Commission under this paragraph shall contain estimates for the calendar year 1967, and also similar estimates for the calendar year 1965, together with the basis therefor.
2. At the time of its report of the estimates under paragraph 1 of this order for 1968, and biennially thereafter, in addition to the matters described in paragraph 1, the Commission shall report to the President available information as to the production of and trade in other types of brooms which it considers to be competitive with those identified in paragraph 1 and, if practicable, estimates as to the annual consumption of such other brooms.
