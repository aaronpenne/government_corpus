A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 2 of the act of July 1, 1954, as amended (72 Stat. 678), and section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (Public Law 87-794); findings and determinations have been made that adjustments in the imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products were necessary so that such imports would not threaten to impair the national security, such adjustments have been made by Proclamation 3279 (24 F.R. 1781) and modified by Proclamation 3290 (24 F.R. 3527), Proclamation 3328 (24 F.R. 10133), Proclamation 3386 (25 F.R. 13945), Proclamation 3389 (26 F.R. 507, 811), Proclamation 3509 (27 F.R. 11985), and Proclamation 3531 (28 F.R. 4077) ; and 
Whereas
, I find that the interests of national security will be served by relating, as nearly as may be, the maximum levels of authorized imports into Districts I-IV to current domestic production of crude oil and natural gas liquids: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that, effective July 1, 1963, subparagraph(1) of paragraph (a) of section 2 of Proclamation 3279, as amended, is hereby further amended to read as follows : 
(a) (1) In Districts I-IV, for a particular allocation period the maximum level of imports, subject to allocation, of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel shall be an amount equal to the difference between 12.2 percent of the quantity of crude oil and natural gas liquids which the Secretary of the Interior estimates will be produced in these districts during that allocation period and the quantity of imports of crude oil, unfinished oils, and finished products excepted by clause (4) of paragraph (a) of section 1 which the Secretary of the Interior estimates will be imported into these districts during that allocation period. As used in this subparagraph, the term "natural gas liquids means natural gas products and other hydrocarbons such as isopentane, propane, butane, propylene, and butylene, or mixtures thereof, recovered from natural, as by means other than refining. Within such maximum level, the imports of finished products other than residual fuel oil to be used as fuel shall not exceed the level of imports of such products into these districts during the calendar year 1957 and imports of unfinished oils shall not exceed 10 percent of the permissible imports of crude oil and unfinished oils. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 10th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and eighty-seventh.
