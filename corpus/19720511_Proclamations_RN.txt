By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Pursuant to paragraph (a) of section 6 of Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, the Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness maintains a constant surveillance of imports of petroleum and its primary derivatives in respect of the national security.
The Director has found that the national security will not be adversely affected by changes which would increase licensed imports into Districts Iâ€“IV to meet requirements for the remainder of 1972.
The Director, with the advice of the Oil Policy Committee, has recommended that Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, be further amended to adjust imports consistent with this finding.
I agree with the findings and recommendations of the Director and deem it necessary and consistent with the security objectives of Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, to adjust the imports of petroleum and petroleum products, as hereinafter provided.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that, effective as of this date, Proclamation No. 3279, as amended, is further amended as follows:
1. In subparagraph (2) of paragraph (a) of Section 1A, substitute "570,000" for "540,000."
2. In subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of Section 2, substitute "1,165,000" for "965,000."
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
