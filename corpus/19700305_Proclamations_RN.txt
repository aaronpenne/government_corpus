A Proclamation
 
For more than seventy years, the Volunteers of America has served God by helping man. To honor the admirable work of this organization which has helped to place hope in countless human hearts, and to encourage continued support of its programs, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 10, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the second week of March 1970 as Volunteers of America Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby so designate the second week of March 1970.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
