By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The construction industry is one of the largest sectors of the economy of this nation, providing jobs for five percent of our work force. Over the decades, this industry has played a vital role in our lives, helping us meet the need for more homes, schools, hospitals, roads, subways, factories, and recreation facilities. The American construction industry has always met the challenge, supplying us with the highest quality craftsmanship in the world and pioneering countless advances in the field. 
Construction labor and management alike have historically taken pride in their spirit of rugged individualism, a spirit that has enabled them to overcome the adversities imposed upon a seasonal and cyclical industry. 
Because of its unique nature, however, the construction industry is also unusually affected by downturns in the economy. It is with pride that I salute the hearty individuals who persevere in the face of tough obstacles, and I reiterate my commitment to revitalize the construction industry and bring it back to an environment of prosperity. 
The Congress has, by Senate Joint Resolution 122, demonstrated its commitment by requesting me to designate February 28 through March 6, 1982, as National Construction Industry Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim February 28 through March 6, 1982, as National Construction Industry Week. I call upon the people of the United States and all Government agencies to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereby set my hand this first day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
