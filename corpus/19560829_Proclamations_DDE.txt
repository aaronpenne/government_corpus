A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, as a people, we are greatly blessed, both materially and spiritually, and it is fitting that we should recognize the hand of God in every matter affecting us individually and as a Nation; and
Whereas
, with this precept in mind, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved April 17, 1952, provided that the President "shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation"; and
Whereas
 the appointed day is one on which to give solemn thought to the mercies bestowed upon us, to lift up our voices in unified thanks for the spiritual blessings we enjoy, especially the profound blessing of freedom, and to acknowledge in all things the presence of Almighty God:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, in consonance with the Congressional resolution, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, September 12, 1956, as a National Day of Prayer, on which all of us, in our places of business, in our places of worship, in our homes, and in our hearts, may beseech God to continue to watch over us in our daily lives and in the conduct of our national affairs. Let us also render thanks to Him for the manifold bounties vouchsafed us throughout our history.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 29th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-first.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
