A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 section 9 of title 17 of the United States Code, entitled "Copyrights", as codified and enacted by the act of Congress approved July 30, 1947, 61 Stat. 652, provides in part that the copyright secured by such title shall extend to the work of an author or proprietor who is a citizen or subject of a foreign state or nation only:
(a) When an alien author or proprietor shall be domiciled within the United States at the time of the first publication of his work; or
(b) When the foreign state or nation of which such author or proprietor is a citizen or subject grants, either by treaty, convention, agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to its own citizens, or copyright protection, substantially equal to the protection secured to such foreign author under this title or by treaty; or when such foreign state or nation is a party to an international agreement which provides for reciprocity in the granting of copyright, by the terms of which agreement the United States may, at its pleasure, become a party thereto.
and
Whereas
 section 1 of the said title 17 provides in part as follows:
Any person entitled thereto, upon complying with the provisions of this title, shall have the exclusive right:
* * * * *
(e) To perform the copyrighted work publicly for profit if it be a musical composition; * * * Provided, That the provisions of this title, so far as they secure copyright controlling the parts of instruments serving to reproduce mechanically the musical work, shall include only compositions published and copyrighted after July 1, 1909, and shall not include the works of a foreign author or composer unless the foreign state or nation of which such author or composer is a citizen or subject grants, either by treaty, convention, agreement, or law, to citizens of the United States similar rights.
and
Whereas
 section 9 of the said title 17 further provides:
The existence of the reciprocal conditions aforesaid shall be determined by the President of the United States, by proclamation made from time to time, as the purposes of this title may require * * *
and
Whereas
 satisfactory official assurances have been received that after August 15, 1947, as before that date, the laws of India have granted to citizens of the United States the benefit of copyright on substantially the same basis as to citizens of India, including rights similar to those provided by section 1 (e) of the said title 17:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do declare and proclaim:
That after August 15, 1947, as before that date, the conditions specified in sections 9 (b) and 1 (e) of the said title 17 of the United States Code have, as between the United States and India, existed and been fulfilled, and that citizens of India, after August 15, 1947, as before that date, have been and are entitled to all the benefits of the said title 17, except those conferred by the provisions embodied in the second paragraph of section 9 (b) thereof regarding the extension of time for fulfilling copyright conditions and formalities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-first day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
