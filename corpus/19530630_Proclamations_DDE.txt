A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the act of July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261, and section 8 (b) of the act of June 16, 1951, Public Law 50, 82d Congress (7 U.S.C. 624), I issued a proclamation on June 8, 1953, providing that in the event of the expiration on June 30, 1953, of section 104 of the Defense Production Act of 1950, as amended, the products specified in Lists I, II, and III appended to, and made a part of, my proclamation shall, on entry on and after July 1, 1953, be subject to the quantitative limitations and fees set forth in such lists; and
Whereas
, it now appears that the said proclamation is unduly restrictive in certain respects; and
Whereas
, it also appears that the terms of the said proclamation do not specifically state that certain dairy products are to be covered by one or another description in List I according to the percentage content of butterfat which determines the rate of duty applicable under the Tariff Act of 1930:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby find and declare that the release on and after July 1, 1953, of those products specified in Lists I and II under the conditions herein prescribed will not render, or tend to render, ineffective or materially interfere with any program or operation of the Department of Agriculture referred to in the said proclamation of June 8, 1953, nor reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from agricultural commodities with respect to which any of such programs or operations are being undertaken. Accordingly, pursuant to the aforesaid section 22, I hereby proclaim that the provisions of the said proclamation of June 8, 1953, shall not apply with respect to articles specified in Lists I and II which may be imported as samples for taking orders for merchandise, or for the personal use of the importer (including articles for disposition by the importer as bona fide gifts), when the aggregate value of such articles in any importation is not over $10. I hereby further find and declare that a clarifying statement should be added as a footnote to List I in order that the provisions of my original proclamation may be fully understood, and, accordingly, I hereby proclaim that there shall be added as a footnote to List I this statement: "Each enumeration of an article in this list shall include any other article dutiable under the Tariff Act of 1930 as such enumerated article by reason of butterfat content."
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
