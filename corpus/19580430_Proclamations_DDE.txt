A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the youth of our Nation constitutes one of our most valuable assets; and 
Whereas
 the scientific and technological advances of recent years have eased the problems and hardships of everyday living and have lessened the need for physical activity on the part of our young people, with a consequent adverse effect on the health of our Nation; and
Whereas
 the Chairman of the President's Council on Youth Fitness, established in July 1956 to stimulate existing programs and to initiate other measures tending to enhance the fitness of American youth, has recommended that the week beginning June 1, 1958, be designated as National Youth Fitness Week; and
Whereas
 the fitness of our young people can be promoted through the determined and constant effort of all our citizens, both young and old:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 1, 1958, as National Youth Fitness Week.
I request officials of the Government, and I urge American parents, as well as business, labor, agricultural, educational, religious, and civic groups, to use all appropriate means during that week to promote programs and activities which will better the mental, social, spiritual, and physical fitness of the youth of America to the end that we may assure the continuing strength and well-being of our Nation.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
