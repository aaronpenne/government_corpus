A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 November 2, 1945, is the twenty-fifth anniversary of the day on which women throughout the United States first cast their votes in a Presidential election; and
Whereas
 Senate Joint Resolution 107 of the Seventy-ninth Congress, first session, approved October 31, 1945, requests the President of the United States to issue a proclamation designating November 2, 1945, as Woman's Enfranchisement Day; and
Whereas
 the extension of the franchise to women constituted a notable advance in strengthening the democratic basis of our Government; and
Whereas
 the movement for equality has gone steadily forward, culminating on October 24, 1945, in the coming into force, with respect to our country and twenty-eight other countries, of the United Nations Charter which reaffirms "faith in fundamental human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person, in the equal rights of men and women":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate November 2, 1945, as Woman's Enfranchisement Day and call upon the people throughout the United States of America to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington this 31st day of October, in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and forty-five and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
