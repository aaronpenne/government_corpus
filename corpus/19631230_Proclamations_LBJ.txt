A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 diseases of the heart and the circulatory system are responsible for over one-half the deaths occurring annually; and 
Whereas
 over one-half of the ten million Americans afflicted by the cardiovascular diseases are stricken during their most productive years, thereby causing a staggering physical and economic loss to the nation; and 
Whereas
 expanded research has contributed unproved methods of prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of the cardiovascular diseases; and 
Whereas
 substantial progress in combating those diseases is being made by comprehensive educational and community programs which have brought about swift and wide dissemination and use of such improved methods; and 
Whereas
 these programs of research and education have resulted largely from the teamwork between the American Heart Association, its chapters and affiliates, and the Federal Government, particularly the Public Health Service through the National Heart Institute and the Heart Disease Control Program; and 
Whereas
 the results thus far achieved in combating the cardiovascular diseases give hope that the continuation and expansion of these programs may eventually eliminate these diseases as important causes of death; and 
Whereas
 it is essential to the health and well-being of our nation that our citizens be made aware of the medical, social, and economic aspects of the problem of cardiovascular diseases, and the measures being taken to combat them; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by joint resolution approved December 30, 1963, has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation designating February as American Heart Month: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America do hereby proclaim the month of February 1964 as American Heart Month; and I invite the governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and other areas subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to issue similar proclamations. 
I urge the people of the United States to give heed to the nationwide problem of the heart and blood-vessel diseases, and to support the programs required to bring about its solution. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of      America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

Secretary of State.
