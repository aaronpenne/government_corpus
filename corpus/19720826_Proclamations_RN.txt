By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Fifty-two years ago the Secretary of State issued a proclamation declaring the addition of the Nineteenth Amendment to our Constitution. That act marked the culmination of a long struggle by the women of this country to achieve the basic right to participate in our electoral process.
As significant as the ratification of the Nineteenth Amendment was, it was not cause for ending women's efforts to achieve their full rights in our society. Rather, it brought an increased awareness of other rights not yet realized.
In recent years there have been great strides in extending the protection of the law to the rights of women, and in promoting equal opportunities for women. Today more women than ever before serve in policy-making positions in the executive branch of our Government. Throughout the Nation, in State and local government and in the private sphere women are playing a more active role.
Although every woman may not desire a career outside the home, every woman should have the freedom to pursue whatever career she wishes. Although women today have a greater opportunity to do that, we still must do more to ensure women every opportunity to make the fullest contribution to our progress as a Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Saturday, August 26, 1972, as Women's Rights Day and call upon all our citizens and particularly those organizations concerned with the protection of human rights to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 26th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
