By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As we near our Nation's two hundredth anniversary, let all of us, as equal partners in a Nation of justice under law, resolve to work, with all our strength and common sense, to achieve ". . . a more perfect Union, establish justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide for the common defence, promote the general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity. . . ." Through such a rededication to the spirit and principles of the Constitution we can build a better future for every individual American, and a better America for all. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, in compliance with the joint resolutions of the Congress of the United States, call upon appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on Citizenship Day, September 17, 1974-the 187th anniversary of the signing of the Constitution. I urge Federal, State, and local officials, as well as leaders of civic, educational and religious organizations to conduct appropriate ceremonies and programs on that day. 
I also designate as Constitution Week the period beginning September 17 and ending September 23, 1974, and urge all Americans to observe that week with appropriate ceremonies and activities in their schools, churches and in other suitable places in order to foster a better understanding of the Constitution, and of the rights and responsibilities, of United States citizens. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
