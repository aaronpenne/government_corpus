By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 502 of the Trade Act of 1974, as amended (the 1974 Act) and having due regard for the eligibility criteria set forth therein, I have determined that it is appropriate to designate Poland as a beneficiary developing country for purposes of the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP). 
2. Section 604 of the 1974 Act authorizes the President to embody in the Harmonized Tariff Schedule of the United States (the HTS) the substance of the provisions of that Act, and of other Acts affecting import treatment, and actions thereunder. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including but not limited to sections 502 and 604 of the 1974 Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) General note 3(c)(ii)(A) to the HTS, listing those countries whose products are eligible for benefits of the GSP, is modified by inserting in alphabetical order in the list of independent countries "Poland". 
(2) Any provisions of previous proclamations and executive orders inconsistent with the provisions of this proclamation are hereby superseded to the extent of such inconsistency. 
(3) The amendments made by this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (i) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (ii) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after the date of publication of this proclamation in the Federal Register. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
