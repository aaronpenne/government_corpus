By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 satisfactory proof has been given to me by the Government of the Republic of Poland that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are levied or imposed in the waters of Poland or the Free City of Danzig upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in such vessels from the United States, or from any foreign country: 
Now, Therefore, I, Warren G. Harding,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section four thousand, two hundred and twenty-eight of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do hereby declare and proclaim that the foreign discriminating duties of tonnage and imposts within the United States are suspended and discontinued so far as respects the vessels of Poland and the vessels of the Free City of Danzig, and the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in said vessels into the United States from Poland or the Free City of Danzig, or from any other foreign country; the suspension to take effect on and after the date of this Proclamation and to continue so long as the reciprocal exemption of vessels belonging to citizens of the United States, and their cargoes, shall be continued, and no longer.
In testimony whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 in the District of Columbia, this 6th day of May, in the year of our Lord one thousand, nine hundred and twenty-one, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and forty-fifth.
WARREN G. HARDING
By the President:
CHARLES E. HUGHES,
