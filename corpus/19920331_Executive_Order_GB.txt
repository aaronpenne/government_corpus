Disputes exist between certain railroads and their employees represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers as designated on the attached list, which is made a part of this order. 
These disputes have not been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended -188) ("the Act"). 
In the judgment of the National Mediation Board, these disputes threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree that would deprive various sections of the country of essential transportation service. 
NOW, THEREFORE, by the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including section 10 of the Act, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1.
 Creation of Emergency Board.
 There is created effective April 3, 1992, a board of three members to be appointed by the President to investigate these disputes. No member shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of railroad employees or any railroad carrier. The board shall perform its functions subject to the availability of funds. 
Sec. 2. 
Report.
 The board shall report to the President on May 3, 1992, with respect to these disputes. 
Sec. 3. 
Maintaining Conditions.
 As provided by section 10 of the Act, from the date of the creation of the board and for 30 days after the board has submitted its final report to the President, no change in the conditions out of which the disputes arose shall be made by the railroads or the employees, except by agreement of these parties. 
Sec. 4. 
Expiration.
 The board shall terminate upon the submission of the report provided for in section 2 of this order.

The White House,
March 31, 1992.
