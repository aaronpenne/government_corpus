By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On February 9, 1870, President Ulysses S. Grant approved a joint resolution of Congress (16 Stat. 369) providing for meteorological observations and for giving notice of the approach and force of storms.
In the hundred years which have intervened, meteorology and kindred atmospheric sciences have undergone phenomenal development through the skill, ingenuity, and dedication of civilian and military scientists, meteorologists, weather observers and many others serving on land, at sea, and in the air, in peace and in war. Their efforts have been aided through unswerving cooperation by the press and the radio and television industries.
This cooperation has resulted in weather services which touch almost every American life and which provide tremendous benefits in the protection of life and property, assistance to many facets of the national economy, and daily contributions to the public welfare and convenience.
Today, the United States is working diligently with many other nations toward a World Weather Watch which, through increased understanding and use of our environmental resources, will provide vastly improved weather services for the entire world.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of February 1970, as United States Weather Services Month; and I urge our institutions and organizations, public and private, and our citizens, to recognize the achievements of the past century and to offer appropriate appreciation and support for this vital national function on the occasion of its centennial anniversary.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
