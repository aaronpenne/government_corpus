Because this amendment partially removes the restrictions set forth in said regulation proclaimed October 1, 1941 and imposes no new obligation upon the general public with respect to the area described herein, it is found that it is unnecessary to issue said amended regulation subject to the general notice provision and the effective date limitation of sections 4(a) and 4(c), respectively, of the Administrative Procedure Act.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto subscribed my name and caused the seal of the Department of the Interior to be affixed this 5th day of October 1948. 
WILLIAM E. WARNE,
Acting Secretary of the Interior.
And Whereas
 upon consideration it appears that the foregoing regulation will tend to effectuate the purposes of the aforesaid migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1913:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the aforesaid Migratory Bird Treaty Act of July 3, 1918, do hereby approve and proclaim the foregoing amendment of regulation.
This proclamation supersedes proclamation No. 2516 of October 1, 1941, approving and proclaiming the regulation adopted by the Secretary of the Interior on September 17, 1941, designating as closed area certain lands and waters in Harney County, Oregon.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 20th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
ROBERT A. LOVETT,
