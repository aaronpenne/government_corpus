By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
In a time of unprecedented opportunity for leisure-time activities, more and more Americans are discovering the benefits of boating. The ever-increasing traffic on the waterways has made it imperative that all boatmen observe the basic rules of boating safety.
Common sense and courtesy are the two foundations of boating safety. An overloaded boat, failure to heed weather warnings or the taking of other unnecessary risks can, and too often do, lead to boating tragedy. If each boatman takes simple precautions, understands the capabilities of his craft, and exercises ordinary good judgment, tragic losses can be avoided.
Recognizing the need for emphasis on boating safety, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179) has requested that the President proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 29, 1969, as National Safe Boating Week.
I urge the public to take advantage of educational courses in boating safety, and all those who use our waterways for boating to exercise courtesy and apply safe boating practices.
I also invite the Governors of the states and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico and appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag, to provide for the observance of this week.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of March, in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
