 the Government of the United States has agreed with the Governments of the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Nicaragua that the said trade agreements with the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Nicaragua specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of the first recital of this proclamation shall terminate (1) when each country becomes a contracting party to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade as defined in Article XXXII thereof and (2) in the case of the Republic of Finland, when all the concessions which were initially negotiated with Finland contained in Schedule XX of Annex A to the Annecy Protocol of Terms of Accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade enter into force;

Whereas
, the Government of the United States has agreed with the Government of the Kingdom of Sweden that the said trade agreement proclaimed by the President on July 8, 1935, specified in paragraph (c) of the first recital of this proclamation, shall be terminated after June 30, 1950;
4. 
Whereas
, as indicated in the seventh recital of proclamation No. 2888 (15 F.R. 3043) of May 13, 1950, the Republic of Finland and the Republic of Nicaragua became contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade on May 25, 1950, and May 28, 1950, respectively;
5. 
Whereas
 all the tariff concessions initially negotiated with the Republic of Finland contained in Schedule XX of Annex A to the Annecy Protocol of Terms of Accession entered into force on May 25, 1950;
6. 
Whereas
 the said section 350(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, authorizes the President to terminate any proclamation carrying out a trade agreement entered into under such section;
7. 
Whereas
, pursuant to the authority vested in the President by the Constitution and the statutes, including section 350 of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended by section 1 of the act of June 12, 1934, by the joint resolution approved June 7, 1943, by sections 2 and 3 of the act of July 5, 1945 (ch. 474, 48 Stat. 943, ch. 118, 57 Stat. 125, ch. 269, 59 Stat. 410 and 411), and by sections 4 and 6 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 (Public Law 307 81st Congress), the period for the exercise of the said authority having been extended by section 3 of the Trade Agreements Extension Act of 1949 until the expiration of three years from June 12, 1948, on October 10, 1949, I entered into a trade agreement providing for the accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Treaties and Other International Acts Series 1700) of the Governments of the Kingdom of Denmark, the Dominican Republic, the Republic of Finland, the Kingdom of Greece, the Republic of Haiti, the Republic of Italy, the Republic of Liberia, the Republic of Nicaragua, the Kingdom of Sweden, and the Oriental Republic of Uruguay, which trade agreement for accession consists of the Annecy Protocol of Terms of Accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated October 10, 1949, including the annexes thereto (Dept. of State Pub. 3664);
8. 
Whereas
, by Proclamation No. 2867 of December 22, 1949 (14 F.R. 7723),  I proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and the other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles imported into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out the said trade agreement for accession on and after January 1, 1950, which proclamation has been supplemented by Proclamation No. 2874 of March 1, 1950 (15 F.R. 1217), Proclamation No. 2884 of April 27, 1950 (15 F.R. 2479), and by the said proclamation of May 13, 1950;
9. 
Whereas
 the said Proclamation of May 13, 1950, made effective, on and after May 28, 1950, the rate of duty of 7 cents per pound specified in item 709 in Part I of Schedule XX in Annex A of the trade agreement for accession, specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation, with respect to not more than 5,000,000 pounds of butter, entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period from April 1 to July 15, inclusive, in any year;
10. 
Whereas
 the said tariff quota specified in the ninth recital of this proclamation became effective in the second month of the period from April 1, 1950, to July 15, 1950, inclusive, and I determine that it would be appropriate in order to carry out the trade agreement specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation to limit the quantity of butter dutiable at the rate of 7 cents per pound which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the remainder of the said quota period from April 1, 1950, to July 15, 1950, inclusive, to a quantity of not more than 3,571,429 pounds;
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 350(a) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended, do proclaim as follows:
PART I
(a) The said proclamation, of October 3, 1936, which proclaimed the trade agreement with the Republic of Finland, is hereby terminated as of the close of May 24, 1950.
(b) The said proclamation, of September 1, 1936, which proclaimed the trade agreement with the Republic of Nicaragua, and which was terminated in part by the said proclamation of February 8, 1938, is hereby terminated in full as of the close of May 27, 1950.
(c) The said proclamation of July 8, 1935, which proclaimed the trade agreement with the Kingdom of Sweden is hereby terminated as of the close of June 30, 1950.
PART II
To the end that the said trade agreement specified in the seventh recital of this proclamation may be carried out, that not more than 3,571,429 pounds of butter entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period from April 1, 1950, to July 15, 1950, inclusive, shall be dutiable at 7 cents per pound, as specified in the tenth recital of this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this seventeenth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
