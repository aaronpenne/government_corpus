A Proclamation
 
1. Proclamation No. 4768 of June 28, 1980, implementing the Customs Valuation Code, made numerous changes to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS) (19 U.S.C. 1202) and established staged reductions in the rates of duty proclaimed therein, pursuant to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and other trade agreements. 
2. Pursuant to the authority of sections 503(a) (1) and 503(a)(2) (A) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251), and by Proclamation No. 4768, I designated certain articles, identified by specific TSUS item numbers, to receive advanced staging of reductions in the rates of duty applicable to such items. 
3. Section 3 of the Act to Approve and Implement the Protocol to the Trade Agreement relating to Customs Valuation, and for Other Purposes (Public Law 96490 of December 2, 1980) made a number of technical amendments to schedule 4 of the TSUS and authorized the President to proclaim the effective date for certain of those amendments. 
4. In order to continue the previously proclaimed staged reductions and the provisions for advanced staging established
pursuant to sections 503(a) (1) and 503 (a) (2) (A) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 for those products affected by the technical amendments made by P.L. 96490, it is necessary to make certain conforming modifications to the TSUS. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,

(2) Schedule 4, part 1C of the TSUS is modified by deleting items 411.40 (as amended by P.L. 96-490) and 411.42 and by substituting the following in lieu thereof:

(3) The rates of duty established for products of least developed developing countries (LDDC's) by Proclamation No. 4768 for item numbers 404.32, 406.36, and 408.24 of the TSUS shall be the rates inserted in the column entitled "LDDC" for items 403.74, 406.73, and 408.31, respectively, as added by section 3(a) of P.L. 96-490;

(5) The amendments made by paragraphs 2, 3, and 4 of this Proclamation shall be effective on the date of this Proclamation and shall be effective with respect to articles exported on or after the date of this Proclamation.
