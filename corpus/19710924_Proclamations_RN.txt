By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Since 1846, the Smithsonian Institution has admirably fulfilled the stipulations of John Smithson's bequestâ€”"to found . . . an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men." The Smithsonian has pioneered and promoted this country's activities in fields as diverse as meteorology and art collecting, anthropology and aeronautics, ecology and educational experimentation. In the best American tradition it has served as a mecca of hospitality to the scientists and scholars of the world.
As a tribute to the Smithsonian Institution, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 782, has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation announcing the celebration of the one hundred and twenty-fifth anniversary of the Institution and designating September 26, 1971, as a special day to honor its scientific and cultural achievements.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, September 26, 1971, as a special day to honor the scientific and cultural achievements of the Smithsonian Institution.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand on this twenty-fourth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
