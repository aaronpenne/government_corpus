By virtue of and pursuant to the authority vested in me by sections 411 and 412 of title 2 of the Canal Zone Code, approval June 19, 1934, Rules 17 and 18 of Executive Order No. 4314 of September 25, 1925, establishing rules governing the navigation of the Panama Canal and adjacent waters, are hereby amended to read as follows:
'Rule 17. Tolls exemption for vessels transiting for repairs. Vessels transiting and re-transiting the Panama Canal by prearrangement with the Canal authorities for the sole purpose of having repairs made at the drydocks or shops operated by The Panama Canal shall be exempt from the payment of tolls, but shall pay charges for pilotage, towage, and other services incidental to such transits, at rates to be determined from time to time by the Governor of the Panama Canal: Provided, however, That in case a vessel, after having made a transit for repairs as hereinbefore provided in this section, shall fail to re-transit the Canal to the point of beginning, or shall, at the point of termination of the original transit, receive or discharge cargo, passengers, mail, or baggage, or accomplish any other purpose, other than to obtain repairs, for which vessels usually transit the Canal, tolls shall be collected for the transit at the prescribed rates before such vessel shall be given a clearance and be permitted to proceed.'
'Rule 18. Tolls for vessels making partial transit and return. Vessels passing through the locks at either end of the Panama Canal and returning to the original point of entry without passing through the locks at the other end of the Canal, shall pay the tolls prescribed for a single passage through the Canal. In case such vessels carry cargo or passengers either in passing or returning through the locks, the rate of tolls on laden vessels shall apply.'
SEC. 2. Effective date. This Order shall take effect on April 1, 1939.
