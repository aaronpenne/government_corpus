"(4) (A) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (3) of this subsection, whenever the United States is not in diplomatic relations with any country named in paragraph (3) of this subsection and during such period after resumption of diplomatic relations with such country as the Secretary determines is required to permit an orderly adjustment in the channels of commerce for sugar, the proration or allocation provided for in paragraph (3) of this subsection shall not be made to such country, and a quantity of sugar not to exceed an amount equal to the proration or allocation which would have been made but for the provisions of this paragraph, may be authorized for purchase and importation from foreign countries, except that all or any part of such quantity need not be purchased from any country with which the United States is not in diplomatic relations, or from any country designated by the President whenever he finds and proclaims that such action is required in the national interest. In authorizing the purchase and importation of sugar from foreign countries under this paragraph, special consideration shall be given to countries of the Western Hemisphere and to those countries purchasing United States agricultural commodities.
