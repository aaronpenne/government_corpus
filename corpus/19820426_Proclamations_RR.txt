By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons, a celebration of the achievements and strengths of disabled persons the world over, has now concluded. In that Year, we were made aware of the many accomplishments of disabled people, and we rejoiced at the number of lives that were made richer and more productive through education, rehabilitation, and employment. 
The impetus gained during this celebration must not be lost. We must seize the opportunities afforded by the International Year of Disabled Persons to increase our national awareness of what remains to be done in order to assure all disabled Americans full and active participation in our society. 
I call upon my fellow citizens in both the public and private sectors to join in mutual efforts to pursue the long-term goals set forth during 1981. 
Now, Therefore, in keeping with the aims of Senate Joint Resolution 134, and in order to continue the momentum developed in the International Year of Disabled Persons, I, Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the year 1982 as the "National Year of Disabled Persons." 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 26th. day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
