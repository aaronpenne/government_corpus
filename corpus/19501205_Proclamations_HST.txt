A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United Nations Charter of 1945 and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, adopted by the General Assembly on December 10, 1948, proclaim our belief in basic human rights and fundamental freedoms and in the dignity and worth of the human person; and
Whereas
 the recognition of these rights and freedoms as requisites for a just and lasting peace assumes even greater importance today as the United Nations is engaged in its struggle against armed aggression; and
Whereas
 the firm establishment of these rights and freedoms can be attained only through a common understanding of the moral objectives of the United Nations and through faith in human values; and
Whereas
 the anniversary of the adoption of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights is an appropriate day on which to reaffirm our faith in the rights of man and our determination to obtain their effective recognition:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, having in 1949 designated each December 10 as United Nations Human Rights Day, do hereby call upon all the people of the United States to observe that day again this year with such ceremonies as may best promote an understanding of and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms and contribute to their universal and effective recognition and observance.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 5th day of December in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
