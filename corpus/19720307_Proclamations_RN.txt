By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Nation's unparalleled technological advances have given farmers and ranchers the ability to produce far more, with far less drudgery and uncertainty, than their forebears. This technology, combined with the skill and energy of our farmers and ranchers, has made possible a plentiful supply of high quality agricultural products, thus enabling us to make great strides in the battle against hunger.
Unfortunately, however, the implements of modern technology have also increased the risk of accidents to our farmers and ranchers. Each year thousands are injured or lose their lives in agricultural accidents or in mishaps on public roads, in homes, or in recreational activities. The dollar cost of these accidents exceeds $2 billion annually, but the price in terms of pain and anguish and disruption of family life is immeasurable.
This drain on the human and economic resources of the agricultural community and the Nation can be reduced if our rural people, acting individually and in concert, take a decisive stand for safety. Many accidents can be prevented by eliminating hazards and using protective equipment at work, by defensive driving, and by general safe practices at home and during recreation.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 25, 1972, as National Farm Safety Week. I urge all persons engaged in agriculture and all those allied with agriculture to take appropriate measures to reduce the number and severity of accidents. Let us strive to bring the technology of safety to agriculture as successfully as we have brought to it the technology of production.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
