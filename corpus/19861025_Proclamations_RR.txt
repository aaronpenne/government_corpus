By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The housing industry has played a major role in our economic prosperity, especially since World War II. Thanks to our free enterprise system, to the vision of many entrepreneurs, and to sound government policies, the housing industry has created millions of jobs, increased demand for goods and services, and generated billions of dollars for our economy. 
Because of this economic activity, millions of Americans have been able to provide safe, secure, and affordable housing for their families. Our communities, our Nation, and the institution of the family itself are much the stronger thereby. The policies of all levels of government should be committed to continuing this situation. 
It is most appropriate that Americans recognize the social and economic benefits the housing industry provides our Nation, and that we remain grateful for the free market system that provides Americans with affordable housing opportunities. 
The Congress, by Public Law 99-419, has designated the week of October 19 through October 26, 1986, as "National Housing Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of October 19 through October 26, 1986, as National Housing Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
