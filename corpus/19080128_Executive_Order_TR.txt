Whereas it is found that Executive order of November 11, 1907, setting apart certain lands for the use of the Indians of the Jicarilla Indian Reservation, New Mexico, conflicts in part with Executive order of November 9, 1907, setting apart certain lands as an addition to the Navajo Indian Reservation, New Mexico, said Executive order is hereby so amended that the description of the tract of land thereby set apart for the purpose named therein shall read as follows: 
Beginning at a point on the south boundary of the Jicarilla Indian Reservation on the range line between townships 26 and 27 north, ranges 2 and 3 west, New Mexico principal meridian; thence west on said south boundary to the southwest corner of the reservation; thence continuing west on the township line between townships 26 and 27 north to the northwest corner of township 26 north, range 5 west; thence south to the southwest corner of township 22 north, range 5 west; thence east along the township line between townships 21 and 22 north to the northeast corner of township 21 north, range 4 west; thence continuing east over unsurveyed lands along what would be, if established, the township line between townships 21 and 22 north to what would be, if established, the southeast corner of township 22 north, range 2 west; thence north over unsurveyed lands to what will be when established the northeast corner of township 23 north, range 2 west; thence west over unsurveyed lands along what would be, if established, the township line between townships 23 and 24 north to what would be, if established, the southeast corner of township 24 north, range 4 west; thence north over unsurveyed lands to the southeast corner of township 25 north, range 4 west; thence continuing north along the east line of township 25 north, range 4 west, to the southeast corner of township 26 north, range 4 west; thence east over unsurveyed lands what would be, if established, the township line between townships 25 and 26 north to what would be, if established, the southeast corner of township 26 north, range 3 west; thence north to the place of beginning.
