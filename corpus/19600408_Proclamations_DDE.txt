A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the existence of the United States as a free Nation is dependent upon the unswerving and enlightened loyalty of its people; and
Whereas
 our priceless heritage of freedom is in constant danger from forces inimical to our traditional concepts of government, among which is our fundamental principle of liberty under law; and
Whereas
 it is appropriate that on one special day of the year we give grateful expression to our country's deep hold upon our hearts and minds; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a Joint resolution of July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369), has designated May 1 of each year as Loyalty Day, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation inviting the people of the United States to observe such day with appropriate ceremonies:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States, and all patriotic, civic, and educational organizations, and all other interested organizations, to observe Sunday, May 1, 1960, as Loyalty Day, in Churches, schools and other suitable places, with appropriate ceremonies in which all of our people may join in the expression and reaffirmance of their loyalty to the United States.
I also call upon the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day as a manifestation of our loyalty to the Nation which that flag symbolizes.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eighth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
Secretary of State
