By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Leif Erikson and his crew of adventurous Norse seafarers sailed across the northern seas nearly a thousand years ago and landed on the shores of North America. These resourceful explorers opened new horizons to the westâ€”a truly courageous and historic achievement.
Born of vision, courage and determination, Leif Erikson's success became an inspiration for later accomplishments. The spirit of Leif Erikson has continued to inspire millions of people, particularly the ten million Americans whose ancestors came from the Viking lands.
It is especially appropriate that we recognize Leif Erikson's explorations in 1969, the year in which a new kind of explorers landed on the moon and returned home to inspire all mankind from now on.
I am honored to comply with the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, October 9, 1969, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
