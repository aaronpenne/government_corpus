By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Machine tools are the master tools that industry requires in the production of all metal products essential to our daily needs and to our national defense.
A strong machine tool industry improves the productivity of all industries and places a greater quantity of consumer goods within the reach of more people. It is vital to the continuing growth of our economy, and contributes to improving the quality of American life.
Mindful of these facts, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 1194 has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the period beginning September 20, 1970, and ending September 26, 1970, as National Machine Tool Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period beginning September 20 and ending September 26, 1970, as National Machine Tool Week; and I call upon the people of the United States and interested groups and organizations to observe such week with appropriate ceremonies and activities.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
