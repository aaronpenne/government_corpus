By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and to expand the executive branch's program for physical fitness and sports and establish the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports (the "Council"), it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. Purpose. The Secretary of Health and Human Services (Secretary) shall, in carrying out his responsibilities for public health and human services, develop and coordinate a national program to enhance physical activity and sports participation.

 expand availability of quality information and guidance regarding physical activity and sports participation;
 (d)
 integrate physical activity into a broader health-promotion and disease-prevention effort through Federal agencies and the private sector; and
 (e)
 target all Americans, with particular emphasis on children and adolescents, as well as populations or communities in which specific risks or disparities in participation in, access to, or knowledge about the benefits of physical activity have been identified.
Sec. 2. The President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
 (a)
 There is hereby established the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.
 (b)
 The Council shall be composed of up to 20 members appointed by the President. The President may designate one or more
