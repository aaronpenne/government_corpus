A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), authorized and requested the President "to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 of each year as Child Health Day and inviting all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to unite upon that day in the observance of such exercises as will awaken the people of the Nation to the fundamental necessity of a year-round program for the protection and development of the health of the Nation's children"; and
Whereas
 every citizen of our country has an inescapable obligation to aid in insuring the American child's birthright of health and of freedom from handicaps; and 
Whereas
 accidents are the leading cause of death and an important cause of crippling among children:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate May 1, 1947, as Child Health Day; and I invite interested individuals and agencies to observe the day with appropriate ceremonies designed to stimulate interest in and devotion to the cause of child welfare in the coming year.
I call upon parents to dedicate themselves on that day to the exercise of unusual diligence throughout the year toward the prevention of accidents in the home, so that the children may be protected from needless injury and suffering and may receive and enjoy the blessings of health and happiness.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 8th day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
