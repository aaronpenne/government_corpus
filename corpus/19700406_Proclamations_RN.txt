By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The restoration of our merchant fleet to a position, of leadership on the world's oceans is one of our most urgent tasks. Our merchant ships are essential parts of our economic and defense systems, and reminders to us and to the world of our heritage as a sea-going people.
In recognition of the importance of our Merchant Marine to our economy and our national security, the Congress in 1933 set aside May 22 of each year as National Maritime Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on May 22, 1970, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day in tribute to the American Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
