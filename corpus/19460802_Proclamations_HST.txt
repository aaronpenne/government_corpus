A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on August 14, 1945, the victory of the Allied Nations was consummated by the unconditional surrender of the armed forces of the Empire of Japan, which terminated a conflict world-wide in scope and freed the people of the world from the threat of enslavement of body and spirit; and
Whereas
 this victory was dearly bought not only by unlimited expenditure of material and effort but also by a heroic sacrifice of life; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that our people should recall with pride the sacrifices which have been made and renew their devotion to the cause for which they fought; and
Whereas
, although victorious in arms, we must not relax our determination or diminish our efforts for the attainment of the final goal - the establishment of a just and enduring peace.
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, August 14, 1946, as Victory Day; and I direct that on that day the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings.
And I call upon the people of the United States to observe Victory Day as a day of solemn commemoration of the devotion of the men and women by whose sacrifices victory was achieved, and as a day of prayer and of high resolve that the cause of justice, freedom, peace, and international good-will shall be advanced with undiminished and unremitting efforts, inspired by the valor of our heroes of the Armed Services.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 2nd day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
Acting Secretary of State.
