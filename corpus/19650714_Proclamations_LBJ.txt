A Proclamation
 
Losses by fire-especially those resulting from fires which could have been prevented-constitute a tragic waste of human and material resources. 
Much of this waste is avoidable. Community fire prevention programs, effectively conducted, have contributed substantially to local and national development by reducing sharply the number of destructive fires. 
Further progress can be made if every individual recognizes his responsibility for eliminating fire hazards and for participating in community fire prevention programs and related activities. 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 3, 1965, as Fire Prevention Week." 
I bid all citizens to support and promote the fire prevention and control efforts of their respective community fire departments. I urge State and local governments, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the American National Red Cross, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies to observe Fire Prevention Week, to provide useful fire safety information to the public and to enlist the active participation of all citizens in year-round fire prevention programs. I also direct the appropriate Federal agencies to assist in this effort to reduce the needless waste of life and property caused by preventable fires. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 14th day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth. 
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
