By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Interstate System of highways, frequently called the greatest public works program in mankind's history, was begun in 1956 and over 70 percent of the mileage is now open to traffic. Interstate will criss-cross the country from north to south and east to west and will provide safe and fast highway transportation to every section of the nation.
This system is the product of a unique Federal-State partnership in roadbuildingâ€”a partnership that has also led to a vastly improved system of primary and secondary roads. It is appropriate that the achievements of this partnership be recognized by every American who benefits from them.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning September 20, 1970, as National Highway Week, and I urge Federal, State and local officials, as well as organizations within the highway industry and other groups, to call attention during that week to what highway transportation means to our nation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-ninth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
