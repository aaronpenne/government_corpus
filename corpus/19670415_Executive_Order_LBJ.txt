WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between Avco Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and certain of its employees at the Lycoming Division Plant, Stratford, Connecticut, represented by International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America, AFLâ€“CIO, and Locals 376 and 1010 thereof; and
WHEREAS, such dispute threatens to result in a strike affecting a substantial part of an industry or industries of the United States engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several states or with foreign nations, or engaged in the production of goods for commerce, which strike, if permitted to occur or continue, would, in my opinion, imperil the national safety;
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act of 1947 (61 Stat. 155; 29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a board of inquiry, consisting of Mr. Leo C. Brown, Chairman, Mr. James C. Hill and Mr. Clyde W. Summers, whom I appoint to inquire into the issues involved in this dispute.
The board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such act. The board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of such act on or before April 17, 1967.
Upon the submission of its report, the board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such act.
