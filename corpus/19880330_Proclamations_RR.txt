By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
For more than a century, the members and friends of the Actors' Fund of America have served the entertainment world by helping show people to aid their own in time of need. This long tradition of concern and compassion for fellow workers truly touches the lives of thousands for the better, exemplifies and perpetuates America's volunteer spirit, and is worthy of every recognition. 
The Actors' Fund assists, in addition to actors, true entertainment professionals who work in any capacity in ballet, circus, the legitimate stage, motion pictures, opera, radio, television, and variety. Its many services and benefits are designed to accommodate the unique needs of those in show business. In wartime and in peacetime, the members of the Actors' Fund have sought to foster the well-being of their fellow entertainers and of all their fellow countrymen. Their active and effective service remains a tribute to them and a blessing for countless people. 
The Congress, by Public Law 100-195, has designated the month of April 1988 as "Actors Fund of America Appreciation Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 1988 as Actors' Fund of America Appreciation Month. I call upon all Americans to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
