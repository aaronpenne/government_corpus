A Proclamation
 
Agriculture remains America's first and most important industry. It supplies food for our people and for many millions throughout the world, and a vast measure of the raw materials used in the making of other products.
Therefore, whatever diminishes or impedes the efficiency and productivity of our farmers is detrimental to men and women everywhere. Each year, accidents kill thousands of farm people, and disable nearly three-quarters of a million more. The resultant economic loss that must be borne by farm families and the Nation approaches two billion dollars.
This waste of human and economic resources, along with the tragic physical and psychological damage suffered by farm men, women, and children, should prompt us to regard the rural accident problem a matter for national concern.
For this reason, I urge all farm families to help make their farms and communities safer by eliminating hazards and discontinuing unsafe practices that cause or contribute to accidents. This is the objective of National Farm Safety Week, 1967.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America do hereby call on the people of the Nation to observe the week of July 23, 1967, as National Farm Safety Week. I urge all persons who live on farms, and those persons and groups allied with agriculture, to respond to applying full energy to the ongoing task of reducing accidents at work, in homes, at recreation, and on the roadways.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
