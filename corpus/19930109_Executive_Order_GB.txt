By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, and as Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces, it is hereby ordered as follows: 
Section 1. There is hereby established a Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal, with accompanying ribbons and appurtenances, for award by the Secretary of Defense or, with respect to the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, the Secretary of Transportation. Members of the Armed Forces of the United States (including Reserve components) who perform outstanding volunteer service to the civilian community of a sustained, direct, and consequential nature are eligible for the medal. 
Sec. 2. The Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal and ribbons and appurtenances thereto shall be of appropriate design approved by the Secretary of Defense. The Secretary of Defense shall prescribe regulations to govern the award and wear of the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal. The regulations shall place the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal in order of precedence immediately after the Humanitarian Service Medal. 
Sec. 3. No more than one award of the Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal may be made to any one person, but for each subsequent act justifying such an award, a suitable device may be awarded to be worn with that medal as prescribed by appropriate regulations issued by the Secretary of Defense. 
Sec. 4. The Military Outstanding Volunteer Service Medal may be awarded posthumously, and when so awarded, may be presented to such representatives of the deceased as may be deemed appropriate by the Secretary of Defense or, in the case of a member of the Coast Guard when it is not operating as a service in the Navy, the Secretary of Transportation.
