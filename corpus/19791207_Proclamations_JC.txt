By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Scouting teaches boys and girls self-reliance, physical fitness and good citizenship. It fosters character development and nurtures a love and understanding of nature and of other people. 
Scouting has a long and proud tradition of service and leadership training. Many of our Nation's most accomplished men and women in every field of endeavor are former Scouts, and cite Scouting as one of their most important early experiences. 
Through the years Scouts have broadened their activities to meet the changing needs of young Americans and help them prepare for useful and rewarding lives. 
In recent years Scouts have been particularly active in promoting energy awareness and conservation, and are continuing this important effort. They are also planning activities designed to aid in taking an accurate census next year. 
By House Joint Resolution 448, the Congress has designated the week of December 3 through December 9, 1979 as "Scouting Recognition Week." 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, call upon all Americans to recognize the contributions of Scouting and to support Scouting programs in their communities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventh day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
