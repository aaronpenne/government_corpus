By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Today the need to develop and expand renewable energy sources that can provide heating, cooling and power for homes, farms and factories is greater than at any other time in our Nation's history. For this reason, Americans are seeking ways of using the sun as an inexhaustible source of clean energy. 
The Federal government and private organizations are working on programs to improve solar technology and encourage greater use of this safe, environmentally acceptable energy source. Our success, however, will depend upon an informed and involved public. 
In order to inform the general public, industry and labor about solar technologies and to demonstrate the sun's potential in meeting America's energy needs, the Ninety-fifth Congress has adopted a joint resolution (H.J. Res. 715) designating Wednesday, May 3, 1978, as Sun Day and calling upon the President to issue a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, May 3, 1978, as Sun Day and call upon the American people to observe that day with appropriate activities and ceremonies that will demonstrate the potential of solar energy. I direct all appropriate Federal agencies to support this national observance. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 27th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
