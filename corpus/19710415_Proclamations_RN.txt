By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Trade between nations is an expression of mutual dependence and good will. The international flow of goods is an instrument of world cooperation that fosters the wellbeing of peoples.
A strong position in world trade and investment has become a basic pillar of the American economy. It also helps raise the standards of living of other peoples of the world by making more widely available our advanced technologies and our capital.
Now, more than ever before, the United States must seek to strengthen its role as a key supplier to the global marketplace. An increased international effort will accelerate foreign exchange earnings, strengthen the position of the dollar abroad and enable us to meet our responsibilities to the international community. It will also provide added stimulus to our economy at home as it moves towards our national objective of full employment through increased productivity.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 16, 1971, as World Trade Week, and I call upon the business community and the American people to consider world trade as an important national priority which warrants their attention and productive efforts. I request that appropriate Federal, State, and local officials cooperate in observing that week.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
