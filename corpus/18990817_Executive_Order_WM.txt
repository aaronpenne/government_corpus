 To the People of Cuba:
 
The disorganized condition of your island, resulting from the war and the absence of any generally recognized authority aside from the temporary Military Control of the United States, has made it necessary that the United States should follow the restoration of order and peaceful industry by giving its assistance and supervision to the successive steps by which you will proceed to the establishment of an effective system of self-government.
As a preliminary step in the performance of this duty I have directed that a census of the people of Cuba be taken, and have appointed competent and disinterested citizens of Cuba as Enumerators and Supervisors.
It is important for the proper arrangement of your new Government that the information sought shall be fully and accurately given and I request that by every means in your power you aid the officers appointed in the performance of their duties.
