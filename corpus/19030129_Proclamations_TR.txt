By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 The Yellowstone Forest Reserve and The Teton Forest Reserve, in the State of Wyoming, and The Absaroka Forest Reserve, in the State of Montana, have been heretofore established by proclamations, under the provisions of the acts of March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," and June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes";
And Whereas,
 it appearing proper that the area embraced in said forest reserves with certain additions thereto should be included in one reserve and be distinguished by one name; and it appearing that the public lands in the States of Wyoming and Montana, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving the same as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that the proclamations heretofore issued respecting said forest reserves are hereby superseded, and The Yellowstone Forest Reserve is hereby established in place thereof, with boundaries as follows, to wit:
