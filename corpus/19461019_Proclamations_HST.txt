A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 air mail has furnished a fresh opportunity for the interchange of thought, and the mail airplane, winging its way to the furthermost places, has become an emissary of peace and social progress; and
Whereas
 the Post Office Department has planned, for the week of October 27 to November 2, 1946, a program to encourage the expansion of mail service over the highways of the air:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of October 27 to November 2, 1946 as National Air Mail Week and urge the people of the United States and its territories and possessions to join in the observance of this week, which marks another milestone on the road to international unity:
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 19th day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES F. BYRNES,
