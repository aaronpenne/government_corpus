By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress resolved "That the flag of the thirteen United States be thirteen stripes, alternate red and white: that the union be thirteen stars, white in a blue field, representing a new constellation"; and
Whereas
 the flag's original field of stars has expanded with the passing years as our Nation has grown and prospered under the principles of liberty, justice, and representative government; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that on the anniversary of its origin we pay especial honor to the Stars and Stripes, which stands for the basic principles of our Republic; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved August 3, 1949 (63 Stat. 492), designated June 14 of each year as Flag Day and requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Sunday, June 14, 1959, to be Flag Day; and I call upon the responsible officials of the Federal Government and of the State and local governments to arrange for the display of the flag on all public buildings on that day.
I also urge the people of the United States to observe Flag Day by flying the flag at their homes and other suitable places and by organizing and participating in appropriate services and ceremonies.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this tenth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
DOUGLAS DILLON,
Acting Secretary of State.
