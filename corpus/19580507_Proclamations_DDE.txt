A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the spirit of motherhood adds strength and grace to the children of men; and
Whereas
 by precept and example the mothers of America have a daily opportunity to shape the lives and destinies of our citizens; and
Whereas
, in recognition of their place in our homes and in our hearts, we are wont to pay special homage to our mothers on one day of each year; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 8, 1914 (38 Stat. 770), gave official recognition to this annual observance by designating the second Sunday in May of each year as Mother's Day, and by requesting the President to issue a proclamation calling for the celebration of that day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request the observance of Sunday, the eleventh day of May, 1958, as Mother's Day; and I direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
I also call upon the people of the Nation to display the flag at their homes or other suitable places on Mother's Day, as a public demonstration of our esteem for the mothers of our land; and to reaffirm on that day our gratitude for the heritage of love and honor our own mothers have bequeathed to each one of us.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 7th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
