Civil service rule No. 12 is hereby amended to read as follows, concerning removals:
"1. In making removals or reductions, and in other punishment, penalties like in character shall be imposed for like offenses.
"2. No person shall be removed from a competitive position except for such cause as will promote the efficiency of the service. When the President or head of an executive department is satisfied that an officer or employe in the classified service is inefficient or incapable and that the public service will be materially improved by his removal, such removal may be made without notice to such officer or employe, but the cause of removal shall be stated in writing and filed. When misconduct is committed in the view and presence of the President or head of an executive department, removal may be made summarily, and no statement of reasons need be filed.
"3. Where a recommendation for removal or reduction in grade or compensation of an officer or employe is made to the head of an executive department by a bureau chief or other subordinate officer, the said head of the department may, in his discretion, require that the person sought to be removed be furnished with a statement in writing of the reason for such action, and be allowed a reasonable time for personally answering the same.
"4. The civil service commission shall have no jurisdiction to vestigate any removal unless it is alleged that the procedure required by section 2 of rule 12 has not been followed or that the removal was made for political or religious reasons."
