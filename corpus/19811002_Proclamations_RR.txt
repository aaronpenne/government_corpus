By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
One of America's great strengths is its private enterprise system. The personal and economic freedom enjoyed by our people turned our fledgling nation, in a few short years, into an economic dynamo that astounded the world. 
Today, the unique blend of individual opportunity, incentive and reward that is the free enterprise system provides Americans with an unparalleled standard of living. 
As the foundation of our economic life, free enterprise depends on and serves every American. It is the enemy of poverty. It permits Americans to be the most compassionate of people, at home and to those in need abroad. 
Through their insistence on the free enterprise system, our forefathers unleashed the creative energies of a people, built the foundation of our unparalleled political and economic freedom, and brought forth a vital force in the world. 
In recognition of the importance of our free enterprise system, the Congress has, in Senate Joint Resolution 78, designated October 2, 1981, as American Enterprise Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim October 2, 1981, as American Enterprise Day. I urge all Americans to observe this occasion with appropriate activities, and in particular to encourage in our youth an appreciation and enthusiasm for the role of free enterprise in our nation's life. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this second day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
