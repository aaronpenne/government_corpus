"(e) The local board shall also order for armed forces physical examination those registrants who have not attained age 26 and who have not previously had such an examination, who request such examination. Requests for examinations must be submitted in writing to the registrant's local board. The local board shall establish a specific date for the examination, which date shall be within 60 days of the receipt of the applicant's request, and the registrant shall be given written notice thereof at least 15 days prior to the date of such examination. Each registrant shall have the right to receive only one preinduction examination on his own request. The Director of Selective Service may temporarily suspend the provisions of this paragraph for particular States or particular local hoards if he determines that the number of such requests, if granted, would adversely affect the processing of men toward induction or would increase the total workloads of the respective Armed Forces Examining and Entrance Stations beyond their capacities. If any registrant is found acceptable upon examination at his request, he will not be selected for induction until his normal sequence number is reached."
