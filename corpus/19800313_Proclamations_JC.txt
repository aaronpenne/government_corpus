By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The nuclear powered aircraft carrier U.S.S. Carl Vinson (CVN 70) will be christened and launched at Newport News, Virginia on March 15, 1980. 
The namesake of this, the largest warship ever constructed, the Honorable Carl Vinson, served as a member of the House of Representatives from 1914 to 1965 during which time he served as the Chairman of the old House Naval Affairs Committee for 16 years and as the Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for 14 years. Carl Vinson played a major role in developing a national defense posture second to none, believing always in a philosophy that "no man should ever place the defense of his nation below any other priority." 
Carl Vinson's record of over 50 years of continuous service in the House of Representatives remains unsurpassed, reflecting a lifelong commitment to the security and freedom of all Americans. He served his country with distinction, providing enlightened leadership, and demonstrating an incomparable ability as a legislator. 
On March 15, 1980 Carl Vinson will be present in Newport News, Virginia, as the first living American to be present at the launching of a United States Navy warship which bears his name. In recognition of this unique occasion, and in honor of this great American, the 96th Congress, by joint resolution (S.J. Res. 149), has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation honoring Carl Vinson. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby extend best wishes to Carl Vinson on this historic occasion, and express deep appreciation on behalf of the United States to Carl Vinson and his unswerving devotion to his beloved nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth. 
JIMMY CARTER
