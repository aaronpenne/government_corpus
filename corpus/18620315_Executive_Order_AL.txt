NAVY DEPARTMENT
Lieutenant JOHN L. WORDEN, United States Navy,
 Commanding United States Steamer Monitor, Washington.
 
SIR: The naval action which took place on the 10th instant between the
 Monitor
 and
 Merrimac
 at Hampton Roads, when your vessel, with two guns, engaged a powerful armored steamer of at least eight guns, and after a few hours' conflict repelled her formidable antagonist, has excited general admiration and received the applause of the whole country.
The President directs me, while earnestly and deeply sympathizing with you in the injuries which you have sustained, but which it is believed are but temporary, to thank you and your command for the heroism you have displayed and the great service you have rendered.
The action of the 10th and the performance, power, and capabilities of the
 Monitor
 must effect a radical change in naval warfare.
Flag-Officer Goldsborough. in your absence, will be furnished by the Department with a copy of this letter of thanks and instructed to cause it to be read to the officers and crew of the
 Monitor
 .
I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
GIDEON WELLES.
