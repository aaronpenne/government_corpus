A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, soon after the adoption of our Declaration of Independence, Count Casimir Pulaski, a Polish patriot, came from across the seas to join our army of freedom; and
Whereas
, he quickly distinguished himself in battle; was made Brigadier General by the Continental Congress and formed the cavalry Legion which bore his name; and
Whereas
 on October 9, 1779, while leading his troops in an attempt to divide the enemy forces at Savannah, he received a grievous wound from which he died two days later, thus sacrificing a young life which gave promise of further contributions to the cause of liberty; and
Whereas
, in acknowledgment of our debt to General Pulaski for his valorous conduct in our War for Independence, it is fitting that we pay tribute to his memory on the one hundred and seventy-eighth anniversary of his death:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, the eleventh day of October, 1957, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I invite the people of this Nation to observe the day with appropriate commemorative ceremonies. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day in honor of the memory of General Casimir Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twelfth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
