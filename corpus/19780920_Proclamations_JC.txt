By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Three hundred and forty-two years ago, the First Militia Regiment of the Massachusetts Bay Colony was organized to enable the colonists to defend themselves and their settlement. That step toward citizen self-defense was the beginning of our National Guard, the oldest military organization in the United States. 
Over those three centuries, names have changed—Militia, State Troops, State Volunteers, and, finally, the National Guard—but the spirit of the citizensoldier has been constant. It is exemplified by those who stand prepared to leave their civilian occupations, don the uniform of their Country, and serve their States and their Nation when the need arises. 
In time of war, the Guard is always ready to serve. At King's Mountain, the Meuse-Argonne, Bataan, Omaha Beach, and the Iron Triangle, during the Berlin Airlift and Vietnam, the Guard has served in every major conflict in which this country has engaged. 
When disaster strikes in time of peace, the Guard is equally ready to serve—as it has, in recent years, at Johnstown, Texas City, and in the wake of Hurricane Agnes. 
In recognition of the debt of gratitude owed by the people of the United States to those who serve as members of the National Guard, the Congress has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation designating October 7, 1978, as National Guard Day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, ask all Americans to celebrate Saturday, October 7, 1978, as National Guard Day and to honor the Army and Air National Guard of the United States for service to their communities, to their States and to their Nation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
