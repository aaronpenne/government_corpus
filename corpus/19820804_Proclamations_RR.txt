By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Over the past half century a great change has been taking place in the social and economic structure of the United States: mothers are joining the labor force in ever-increasing numbers. At the present time, over half of all the children in America have mothers who work outside the home. 
Over forty-three million women are now employed in every area of public and private employment and are continuing to develop new opportunities. They have made, and continue to make, increasingly important contributions to the Nation. 
Of these forty-three million working women, over eighteen million simultaneously perform the vitally important role of mother. 
These women make substantial contributions both to the Nation's economic growth and to the increasing strength of the American family, often at great personal sacrifice. They deserve our recognition and gratitude. 
Most other mothers are working full time in the home. Their work is no less important. The guidance they give their children and the maintenance of a strong and cohesive family unit also contribute to the Nation's economic growth. 
By Senate Joint Resolution 53, the Congress of the United States has authorized and requested the President to designate September 5, 1982, as "Working Mothers' Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 5, 1982, as "Working Mothers' Day" and call upon families, individual citizens, labor and civic organizations, the media, and the business community to acknowledge the importance of the mothers who work inside or outside the home and to express appreciation for their role in American society. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 4th day of Aug, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightytwo, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventh.
RONALD REAGAN
