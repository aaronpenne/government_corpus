A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our country, built by people of many races, creeds, and national origins, has become a preeminent force in the furtherance of the cause of human freedom; and
Whereas
 our Nation now needs, more than ever before, citizens who know and understand our great heritage of democracy, which stresses the creed of the good neighbor, equality of justice, and equality of opportunity; and
Whereas
 it is vitally essential that each citizen, naturalized or native-born, reaffirm his faith in the basic principles that mold our way of life by forthrightly assuming and carrying out the obligations of citizenship:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Congress through Public Resolution 67, approved May 3, 1940, do hereby designate Sunday, May 21, 1950, as "I Am an American Day", and do set aside that day as a public occasion for the special recognition of those of our youth who have become of age and of those foreign-born who have been naturalized during the past year. And I urge all Americans at that time to reaffirm their devotion to the ideals that have shaped our Nation's destiny and to faithfully resolve that they will discharge the obligations of United States citizenship.
I call upon Federal, State, and local officials, as well as patriotic, civic, educational, and other appropriate organizations and groups to arrange for suitable ceremonies on or about May 21, in which all our people may join with those who have newly assumed the responsibilities of American citizenship, with a view to promoting among all our citizens, old and new, a consciousness of their privileges and duties as Americans.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 17th day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
