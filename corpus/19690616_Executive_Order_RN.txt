By virtue of the authority vested in me by section 212 of the Federal Salary Act of 1967 (Public Law 90-206, 81 Stat. 634), and after seeking the views of employee organizations as provided therein, it is hereby ordered as follows:
General Schedule
SECTION 1. (a) The rates of basic pay in the General Schedule contained in section 5332(a) of title 5, United States Code, are adjusted as follows:
(b) Except as provided in section 5303 of title 5, United States Code, the rates of basic pay of officers and employees to whom the General Schedule set forth in this section applies shall be initially adjusted as of the effective date of this order as follows:
(1)	If the officer or employee is receiving basic pay immediately prior to the effective date of this order at one of the rates of a grade in the General Schedule, he shall receive a rate of basic pay at the corresponding rate in effect on and after such date.
(2)	If the officer or employee is receiving basic pay immediately prior to the effective date of this order at a rate between two rates of a grade in the General Schedule, he shall receive a rate of basic pay at the higher of the two corresponding rates in effect on and after such date.
(3) If the officer or employee is receiving basic pay immediately prior to the effective date of this order at a rate in excess of the maximum rate of his grade, he shall receive his existing rate of basic pay increased by the amount of increase made by this section in the maximum rate for his grade.
(4) If the officer or employee, immediately prior to the effective date of this order, is receiving, pursuant to section 2 (b) (4) of the Federal Employees Salary Increase Act of 1955, an existing aggregate rate of pay determined under section 208 (b) of the Act of September 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 1111), plus subsequent increases authorized by law, he shall receive an aggregate rate of pay equal to the sum of his existing aggregate rate of pay on the day preceding the effective date of this order, plus the amount of increase made by this section in the maximum rate of his grade, until (i) he leaves his position, or (ii) he is entitled to receive aggregate pay at a higher rate by reason of the operation of any provision of law; but, when such position becomes vacant, the aggregate rate of pay of any subsequent appointee thereto shall be fixed in accordance with applicable provisions of law. Subject to clauses (i) and (ii) of the immediately preceding sentence of this paragraph, the amount of the increase provided by this section shall be held and considered for the purposes of section 208(b) of the Act of September 1, 1954, to constitute a part of the existing rate of pay of the employee.
Schedules for the Postal Field Service
SEC. 2 (a) The rates of basic compensation in Postal Field Service Schedule II contained in section 3542(a) of title 39, United States Code, are adjusted as follows:
(b) The rates of basic compensation in the Rural Carrier Schedule II contained in section 3543(a) of title 39, United States Code, are adjusted as follows:
(c) The basic compensation of each employee subject to the Postal Field Service Schedule or the Rural Carrier Schedule immediately prior to the effective date of this order shall be determined as follows :
(1) Each employee shall be assigned to the same numerical step for his position which he had attained immediately prior to such effective date. If changes in levels or steps would otherwise occur on such effective date without regard to the provisions of this order, such changes shall be deemed to have occurred prior to conversion.
(2) If the existing basic compensation is greater than the rate to which the employee is converted under paragraph (1) of this subsection, the employee shall be placed in the lowest step which exceeds his basic compensation. If the existing basic compensation exceeds the maximum step of his position, his existing basic compensation shall be increased by the amount of increase made by this section in the maximum rate of his level.
