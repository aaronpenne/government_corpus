By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved on April 17, 1952 (66 Stat. 64), provided that the President "shall set aside and proclaim a suitable day each year, other than a Sunday, as a National Day of Prayer, on which the people of the United States may turn to God in prayer and meditation"; and
Whereas
 Americans of every generation have sought and found in Almighty God help and guidance in their personal and national problems; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that all Americans should unite in prayer on one day of each year in reaffirmation of our reliance upon divine support and our faith in the power of prayer:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, September 22, 1954, as a National Day of Prayer, when all of us may give thanks for blessings received, and beseech God to strengthen us in our efforts toward a peaceful world.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eleventh day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
