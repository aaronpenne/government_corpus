By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
It is fitting that a magnificent redwood grove in Redwood National Park be dedicated in honor of Lady Bird Johnson, who has done so much to stir in the American conscience a deepened sense of unity with our national environment. Mrs. Johnson has given generously of her time and talents on behalf of the natural beauty of the land she loves so well. That beauty is uniquely expressed in the Redwood National Park established by the Act of Congress of October 2, 1968, while Mrs. Johnson was First Lady of the land.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do proclaim that the following described land within the boundaries of the Redwood National Park is hereby designated as the Lady Bird Johnson Grove:
In Witness Whereof,
 I have 'hereunto set my hand this 27th day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
