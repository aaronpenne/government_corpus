WHEREAS foreign trade is an essential and continuing element in sustaining the growth, strength, and prosperity of our economy, contributes to the improvement of our balance of payments, and fosters the long-term commercial interest of the United States; and
WHEREAS, on March 20, 1968, I requested the Congress to empower the Export-Import Bank of the United States to use up to $500,000,000 of its loan, guarantee, and insurance authority to finance a broadened program to sell American goods in foreign markets; and
WHEREAS the Congress has authorized the Bank to extend loans, guarantees, and insurance which, in the judgment of the Board of Directors of the Bank, offer sufficient likelihood of repayment to justify the Bank's support in order to actively foster the foreign trade and long-term commercial interest of the United States; and
WHEREAS it is desirable and appropriate that guidance concerning the commercial interests and the balance of payments objectives of the United States be provided to the Board of Directors of the Bank in the use of such loan, guarantee, and insurance authority allocated to finance export expansion, and I have stated-that I would establish an Export Expansion Advisory Committee to provide-such guidance to the Board of Directors of the Bank:
