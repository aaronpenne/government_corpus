A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the strength of our national economy is dependent upon the existence of a modern land, air, and sea transportation system; and
Whereas
 that transportation system must, at all times, be capable of fully supporting the military activities of our armed forces during any emergency, or during any period of hostilities in which this country may be engaged; and
Whereas
 this Nation's transportation industry has admirably demonstrated its ability to develop and maintain such a system, and, in doing so, renders outstanding service to our people; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 16, 1957 (71 Stat. 30), has requested the President annually to issue a proclamation designating the third Friday of May of each year as National Defense Transportation Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, May 15, 1959, as National Defense Transportation Day, and I urge all our people on that day to join in appropriate activities and ceremonies with the various branches of the transportation industry and with representatives of the armed forces and other governmental agencies. I also invite the Governors of the States to provide for the observance of that day in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the people of each community to recognize the importance of modern transportation.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 12th day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
