GENERAL ORDERS, NO. 76.
WAR DEPARTMENT
ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE
SENTENCE OF DESERTERS.
The President directs that the sentences of all deserters who have been condemned by court-martial to death, and that hare not been otherwise acted upon by him, be mitigated to imprisonment during the war at the Dry Tortugas, Florida, where they will be sent under suitable guards by orders from army commanders.
The commanding generals, who have power to act on proceedings of courts-martial in such cases, are authorized in special cases to restore to duty deserters under sentence, when in their judgment the service will be thereby benefited.
Copies of all orders issued under the foregoing instructions will be immediately forwarded to the Adjutant-General and to the Judge-Advocate-General.
By order of the Secretary of War:
E. D. TOWNSEND,
 Assistant Adjutant-General.
