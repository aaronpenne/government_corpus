By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
On this the one hundred and ninety-first anniversary of the death of Casimir Pulaski, we recall with gratitude his gallant efforts and his sacrifice in helping this country to win its independence.
General Pulaski died on October 11, 1779, of a wound received two days earlier while leading a cavalry charge in the city of Savannah, Georgia. This anniversary reminds us of his great contribution and that of succeeding generations of American citizens of Polish origin to the freedom and progress of this Nation.
It is appropriate that we commemorate General Pulaski's belief in liberty for which he gave his life in the cause of American independence. In doing so, we dedicate ourselves anew to those fundamental ideals of freedom on which this Nation was founded and has prospered.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, October 11, 1970, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies in honor of the memory of General Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
