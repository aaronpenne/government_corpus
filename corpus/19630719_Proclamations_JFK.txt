A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our Nation can ill afford the terrible havoc which fire brings to our homes, our businesses, and our lives; and 
Whereas
 our States, municipalities, and industries have organized programs and established plans for more effective protection against devastation by fire; and 
Whereas
 the job of fighting fire by active prevention demands the willing support of those programs and plans by every citizen: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 6, 1963, as Fire Prevention Week. 
I earnestly request that we, as a Nation and as individual citizens, dedicate ourselves to a year-round campaign against the ever-present menace of fire; and I call for maximum efforts from State and local governments, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, the American National Red Cross, and labor, business, farm, and professional organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies, in observing Fire Prevention Week and in enlisting the support of all segments of our society in fire prevention efforts. 
I also direct the appropriate Federal agencies to initiate and carry on effective fire prevention programs which will advance the cause of safety and stem the destruction of our resources by fire. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this nineteenth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
