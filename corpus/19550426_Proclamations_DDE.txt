A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution of May 18, 1928 (45 Stat. 617), has authorized and requested the President of the United States to issue annually a proclamation setting apart May 1 as Child Health Day; and
Whereas
 the health we seek for our children includes their spiritual, emotional, and intellectual, as well as their physical, well-being; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day provides us with an occasion for dedicating ourselves to enlarging the opportunities of children for achieving such health; and
Whereas
 Child Health Day has been given added significance this year by the recently announced discovery of a means of protecting our children from the crippling scourge of poliomyelitis:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Sunday, the first day of May 1955, as Child Health Day; and I invite all citizens, meeting in their various places of worship and elsewhere on that day, to unite in observances that will emphasize the importance of abundant health for all children throughout the coming year.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 26th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
