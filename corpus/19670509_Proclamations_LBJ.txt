A Proclamation
 
Throughout American history, the Merchant Marine has been indispensable to our security and prosperity.
Today, our merchant fleet binds us in peaceful commerce with the increasingly interdependent nations of the world.
In this decade alone, our imports and exports have risen nearly 60 percentâ€”from less than $35 billion in 1960 to nearly $55 billion in 1966.
Merchant ships carry the essentials of life to millions in need. They transport military supplies and equipment to our forces abroad. Of all our supplies being sent to Vietnam today, 98 percent are carried by ship.
To remind Americans of the important role which the merchant marine plays in our national life, the Congress in 1933 designated the anniversary of the first transatlantic voyage by a steamship, the SS Savannah, on May 22, 1819, as National Maritime Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually in observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American Merchant Marine on Monday, May 22, 1967, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day in tribute to the American Merchant Marine.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this ninth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
