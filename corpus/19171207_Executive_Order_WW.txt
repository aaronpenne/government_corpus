By virtue of the authority vested in me by "An act to define, regulate, and punish trading with the enemy and for other purposes," approved October 6, 1917, I hereby make the following orders, rules and regulations:
I. I hereby prohibit any and all foreign insurance companies from doing business within the United States after February 1, 1918, unless such companies shall first obtain from the Secretary of the Treasury licenses to do business.
II. I further hereby vest in the Secretary of the Treasury the power and authority to issue at any time, upon such terms and conditions as the Secretary of the Treasury may deem proper and as are not inconsistent with law, or to refuse, a license to any foreign insurance company to do business within the United States through agencies, branch offices, or otherwise.
