A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the health of our children is of supreme importance to the future of the nation; and
Whereas
 the prevention and early treatment of dental diseases can be a potent factor in the promotion of the general health of our young people; and
Whereas
 a joint resolution of Congress approved on February 1, 1950, provides as follows:
"That the President of the United States is hereby authorized to issue a proclamation setting aside February 6, 1950, as national Children's Dental health Day and to invite all agencies and organizations interested in child welfare to unit upon that day in the observance of such exercises as will call to the attention of the people of the United States the fundamental necessity of a continuous program for the protection and development of the dental health of the nation's children":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Monday, February 6, 1950, as national Children's Dental Health Day. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government and invite the State and local governments and organizations interested in child welfare to cooperate in programs designed to focus public attention upon the vital importance of preserving and improving the dental health of our children.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 1st day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth.
