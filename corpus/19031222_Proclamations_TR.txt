By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 The Pine Mountain and Zaca Lake Forest Reserve and The Santa Ynez Forest Reserve, in the State of California, have been heretofore established by proclamations, under the provisions of the acts of March third, eighteen hundred and ninety-one, entitled, "An act to repeal timber-culture laws, and for other purposes," and June fourth, eighteen hundred and ninety-seven, entitled, "An act making appropriations for sundry civil expenses of the Government for the fiscal year ending June thirtieth, eighteen hundred and ninety-eight, and for other purposes";
And Whereas,
 it appears proper that the area embraced in said forest reserves, with the addition thereto of certain lands, should be included in one reserve and be designated by one name; and it appears that the public lands in the State of California, within the limits hereinafter described, are in part covered with timber, and that the public good would be promoted by setting apart and reserving the same as a public reservation;
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States, by virtue of the power vested in me by the aforesaid acts of Congress, do hereby make known and proclaim that the proclamations heretofore issued respecting said forest reserves are hereby superseded, and The Santa Barbara Forest Reserve is hereby established in place thereof, with boundaries as follows, to wit:

 Provided,
 That this exception shall not continue to apply to any particular tract of land unless the entryman, settler or claimant continues to comply with the law under which the entry, filing or settlement was made.
 Provided further,
 That nothing herein shall give any force or effect to any claim or right to any of the lands heretofore embraced within the reserves hereby consolidated which would not have been entitled to recognition if said reserves as heretofore established had been continued in force without being merged into a single reserve as hereinbefore provided.
Warning is hereby expressly given to all persons not to make settlement upon the lands reserved by this proclamation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
