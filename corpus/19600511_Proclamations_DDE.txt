A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), I issued on June 8, 1953, Proclamation No. 3019 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 189) imposing fees or quantitative limitations on imports of products specified in Lists I, II, and III appended to, and made a part of, that proclamation, which was amended by Proclamation No. 3025 issued June 30, 1953 (3 CFR, 1949-1953 Comp., p. 194), and Proclamation No. 3195 issued August 17, 1957 (3 CFR, 1957 Supp., p. 40); and
Whereas
, at my request, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation under the authority of subsection (d) of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act to determine whether changed circumstances warrant the modification of Proclamation No. 3019, as amended, so as to permit the importation of certain kinds of cheese in excess of the quotas specified therefor in List II appended to that proclamation as amended; and
Whereas
 the Commission has submitted to me a report of its supplemental investigation and its findings and recommendations in connection therewith; and
Whereas
, on the basis of such investigation and report, I find that changed circumstances require the modification, as hereinafter provided, of Proclamation No. 3019, as amended, in order to carry out the purposes of section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby modify, effective July 1, 1960, List II appended to Proclamation No. 3019, as amended, (1) by deleting the figure "4,600,200" specified for "Edam and Gouda cheese" and substituting therefor the figure "9,200,400", and (2) by deleting the figure "9,200,100" specified for "Italian-type cheeses, made from cow's milk, in original loaves (Romano made from cow's milk, Reggiano, Parmesano, Provoloni, Provolette, and Sbrinz)" and substituting therefor the figure "11,500,100".
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this eleventh day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
