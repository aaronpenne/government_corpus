By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Boating on our Nation's waterways has become a source of recreational pleasure for a rapidly increasing number of Americans. Increased use means more enjoyment for more people, but it carries with it an increased responsibility as well. Those who use our waterways must take greater care to observe the rules of good seamanship and of boating safety.
To focus national attention on the need for safe boating practices, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179), requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4 as National Safe Boating Week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 2, 1972, as National Safe Boating Week.
Many boating tragedies could be avoided through education and common sense. I urge all Americans who use our waterways to take advantage of the numerous boating safety courses offered by governmental and private organizations, such as the United States Coast Guard, the Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States Power Squadrons, the American Red Cross, and various State agencies.
Last August I signed into law the Federal Boat Safety Act of 1971, designed to improve boating safety and to encourage State participation in boating safety efforts. I invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Commissioner of the District of Columbia to cooperate in implementing that act, and in providing for the observance of National Safe Boating Week.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
