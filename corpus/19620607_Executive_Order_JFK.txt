WHEREAS, there exists a labor dispute between Republic Aviation Corporation, Farmingdale, Long Island, New York, and certain of its employees represented by Republic Lodge 1987, International Association of Machinists, AFL-CIO; and 
WHEREAS, such dispute has resulted in a strike which, in my opinion, affects a substantial part of the aircraft industry, an industry engaged in trade, commerce, and transportation among the several States and with foreign nations, and which strike will, if permitted to continue, imperil the national health and safety: 
NOW THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 206 of the Labor Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155 (29 U.S.C. 176), I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of Honorable Lloyd K. Garrison, Chairman, Honorable James C. Hill, and Honorable Arthur Stark as members to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute. 
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of such Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of Section 206 of such Act on or before June 14, 1962. 
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under such Act.
