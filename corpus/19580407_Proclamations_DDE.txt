A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 world trade is vital to the economic growth and national security of the United States; and
Whereas
 the export trade of the United States provides employment for millions of Americans and is an indispensable outlet for the products of our farms and factories; and
Whereas
 imports into the United States help to keep factory wheels turning and assembly lines moving for our national defense, and are essential to the domestic economy of our Nation; and
Whereas
 world trade contributes to the economic strength and development of the free nations of the world, and is therefore a powerful force for the advancement of peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 18, 1958, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate officials of the Federal Government and of the several States, Territories, possessions, and municipalities of the United States to cooperate in the observance of that week.
I also urge business, labor, agricultural, educational, and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and our relations with other nations.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 7th day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-second.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
