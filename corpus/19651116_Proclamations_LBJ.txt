A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 traffic accidents constitute one of the Nation's most urgent domestic problems, involving a continuous toll of death, injury, and financial loss; and
Whereas
 the benefits of our vastly improved highways can be fully realized only if we are able to travel them without excessive risk of accidents; and
Whereas
 public officials concerned with traffic safety cannot win the fight against traffic accidents without the active cooperation of private citizens; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Concurrent Resolution 448, agreed to October 22, 1965, has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating November 26, 1965, as Crusade for Safety Day:
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim November 26, 1965, as Crusade for Safety Day. I urge that private citizens throughout the country join public officials in their efforts to improve highway safety through the application of measures designed to prevent traffic accidents.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninetieth.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON

GEORGE W. BALL
