By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation 
Americans have always relied on education to enrich our lives and to keep our Nation free and strong. We have relied as well on our spirit of voluntarism to improve our communities and to help our neighbors. These two traditions are among our Nation's greatest strengths, and we can all take a great deal of pride in our millions of school volunteers who exemplify both of them. 
These volunteers generously contribute their time, talent, and resources to help professional educators enhance classroom instruction. In addition, citizens form business and education partnerships and adopt-a-school initiatives to develop a broader range of educational opportunities for students. All of this support from the community encourages school staffs and furthers the education of our children. The magnitude, quality, and selflessness of these efforts deserve the gratitude of every American who cares about our children and the future of our Nation. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 407, has designated November 19, 1986, as "Salute to School Volunteers Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this day. 
Now, Therefore, L Ronald Reagan, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Wednesday, November 12, 1986, as Salute to School Volunteers Day. I invite government officials, educators, parents, students, and all Americans to observe this day and participate in activities to recognize and show appreciation for school volunteers' contributions to education. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this twelfth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
