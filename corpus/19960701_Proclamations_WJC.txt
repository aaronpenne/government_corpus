By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 an extended drought and other natural disasters in feed grain-producing areas of the United States have caused significant reductions in feed grain supplies and severe hardship to livestock producers;
Now, Therefore, I, William J. Clinton,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including sections 201 and 301 of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1601 et seq.) and section 813 of the Agricultural Act of 1970 (7 U.S.C. 1427a) (the "Act"), do hereby find and proclaim that the extended drought in the Southwest and other natural disasters in other feed grain areas of the United States have resulted in a state of emergency and that the state of emergency warrants the release of the reserve established pursuant to section 813(a) of the Act (7 U.S.C. 1427a(a)). Accordingly, I hereby declare that such amounts of the reserve as determined necessary by the Secretary of Agriculture ("the Secretary") should be disposed of by the Secretary as authorized by the Act.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twentieth.
WILLIAM J. CLINTON
