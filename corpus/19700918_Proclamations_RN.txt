By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Almost ten centuries ago Leif Erikson, inspired by a vision of an abundant land to the West, braved a stormy and uncharted North Atlantic to reach the shores of North America. The legend of Vinland—the land of wild grapes, where wheat sowed itself in naturally cultivated fields, where rivers were of milk and honey, and where dew was sweet and fell like manna from heaven—persisted through the ages. Together with Leif Erikson's example of courage and determination it encouraged many descendants of the Vikings to cross the Atlantic Ocean, settle in this land, and help build the New World.
We are still inspired by men of Leif Erikson's vision and courage. It is, therefore, appropriate that today we give national recognition to this intrepid Norse explorer; and I am pleased to comply with the request of the Congress of the United States, in a joint resolution approved September 2, 1964 (78 Stat. 849), that the President proclaim October 9 in each year as Leif Erikson Day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, October 9, 1970, as Leif Erikson Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of Leif Erikson on that day by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in schools and churches, or other suitable places.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eighteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
