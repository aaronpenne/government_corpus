By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Cancer is the second greatest cause of death in the United States. And the death rate from this terrible disease is still rising.
In the past 25 years we have made progress in early diagnosis of certain types of cancer. Greater drug treatment has increased a victim's chances of survival.
While these medical advances are encouraging, it is evident that only the full-hearted commitment by all Americans to support the splendid efforts of our scientists, physicians, health administrators and volunteers will arrest this disease.
In recognition of the urgency of the cancer problem, the Congress, by a joint resolution of March 28, 1938 (52 Stat. 148), requested the President to issue annually a proclamation setting aside the month of April as Cancer Control Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1969 as Cancer Control Month, and I invite the Governors of the States and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, and appropriate officials of all other areas under the United States flag to issue similar proclamations.
I also ask the medical and allied health professions, the communications industries, and all other interested persons and groups to unite during the appointed month in public reaffirmation of this Nation's efforts to control cancer.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-third.
RICHARD NIXON
