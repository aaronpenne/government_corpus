A Proclamation
 
On October 11, 1779, Casimir Pulaski died a hero in the Battle of Savannah. On this one hundred and ninety-third anniversary of that event, we are reminded of his gallant efforts and great sacrifice in the struggle for our independence. General Pulaski was one of the earliest of the many individuals of Polish ancestry who have contributed mightily to the cause of freedom in America.
In commemorating General Pulaski's dedication to liberty, we also honor the significant contributions made to this Nation by generations of Americans of Polish ancestry. It is fitting, in remembering General Pulaski's example, that we rededicate ourselves to the fundamental principles of freedom and justice for all on which this Nation was founded and for which Casimir Pulaski fought and gave his life.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Wednesday, October 11, 1972, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day.
I invite all Americans to join me in observance of that historic day in appropriate ceremonies to honor the memory of General Casimir Pulaski.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
