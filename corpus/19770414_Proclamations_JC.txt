By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Our nation's small businesses employ 100 million Americans and produce nearly half of our gross business product. Small businesses remain healthy in an economic environment that equates size with success because they take an active interest in the customers and communities they serve. 
A successful small business is evidence of the independence, initiative and hard work of the man or woman who owns and operates it. Their spirit has been, and will continue to be, a major factor in our nation's growth. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning Sunday, May 22, 1977, as Small Business Week, and I ask all Americans to join me in expressing the pride we take in our nation's small business sector. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
