By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
We can trace evidence for skiing back more than 5,000 years. This efficient method of traveling over snow in difficult or inaccessible terrain has benefited mankind in countless ways over the centuries and continues to do so in our land. The practicality and pleasure of skiing are worth celebrating by all of us, and that is the reason for this National Skiing Day. 
Skiing is advantageous to many of us for the jobs and income it generates. It also proves useful for residents of isolated areas; rescue teams; and Armed Forces units. Additionally, national and international sports groups, including Special Olympics International, recognize the athletic and therapeutic benefits of skiing for handicapped people and include it in their regular programs. 
Skiing is now one of our most popular winter sports. It is loved by fans of national, international, and Olympic competition and enjoyed by millions of Americans as healthful, exciting recreation. More and more of us are becoming skiers. The increase of ski trails and slopes on private and public lands is making skiing much more widely available, as is the advent of artificial snow surfaces in areas with mild winter weather. 
In recognition of skiing and its benefits, the Congress, by Public Law 100-634, has designated January 20, 1989, as "National Skiing Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim January 20, 1989, as National Skiing Day. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and thirteenth.
RONALD REAGAN
