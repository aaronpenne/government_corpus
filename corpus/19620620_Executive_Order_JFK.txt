WHEREAS disputes exist between the American Airlines, Inc., a carrier, and certain of its employees represented by the Transport Workers Union of America, AFL-CIO, a labor organization; and 
WHEREAS these disputes have not heretofore been adjusted under the provisions of the Railway Labor Act, as amended; and 
WHEREAS these disputes, in the judgment of the National Mediation Board, threaten substantially to interrupt interstate commerce to a degree such as to deprive a section of the country of essential transportation service: 
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended (45 U.S.C. 160), I hereby create a board of three members, to be appointed by me, to investigate these disputes. No member of the board shall be pecuniarily or otherwise interested in any organization of airline employees or any carrier. 
The board shall report its findings to the President with respect to these disputes within thirty days from the date of this order. 
As provided by Section 10 of the Railway Labor Act, as amended, from this date and for thirty days after the board has made its report to the President, no change, except by agreement, shall be made by the American Airlines, Inc., or by its employees, in the conditions out of which these disputes arose.
