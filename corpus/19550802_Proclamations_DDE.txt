 thousands of lives and hundreds of millions of dollars in property are lost each year through fires; and
Whereas
, as a result of these destructive fires, immeasurable losses are caused in employment, production, and other economic activities; and

 fire prevention programs have proved effective in communities throughout the Nation:

I call upon the citizens of all communities in the land to organize effective programs for reducing the needless waste caused by preventable fires, and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the National Fire Waste Council, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public information agencies, actively to observe Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national effort to reduce the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this second day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
