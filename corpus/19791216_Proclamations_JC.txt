By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Fifty American citizens are being held hostage in Iran by a mob and a government that have become one and the same. The United States has made it clear to the leaders of Iran that we hold them personally and fully responsible for the wellbeing and safe return of every American in their hands. 
The people of the United States are unanimous in their concern for their fellow citizens held in Iran. Americans have shown this concern in numerous ways that are consistent with our country's respect for law?the ringing of church bells, letters to the Iranian Mission at the United Nations, and messages to the hostages themselves. 
A most fitting symbol of this concern is the American flag itself. We respect our flag because we know that it stands for freedom. It stands for justice. It stands for human dignity. It stands too for our united determination to uphold these great ideals. 
To demonstrate support for the hostages in Iran, the Congress has, by joint resolution, designated December 18, 1979. as "National Unity Day." It has requested the President of the United States to call upon all citizens and organizations to observe that day by prominently displaying the American flag. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate December 18, 1979, as National Unity Day. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag on all Government buildings during that day. I urge all Americans to observe National Unity Day, December 18, 1979, by flying the Stars and Stripes from their homes and other suitable places. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
