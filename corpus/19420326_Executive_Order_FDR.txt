Whereas in order that contracts of the War Department, the Navy Department, and the United States Maritime Commission (hereinafter referred to as Maritime Commission) which are now outstanding or may hereafter be entered into for war production, including the obtaining or conversion of facilities, may be promptly and effectively performed, it is essential that additional facilities be provided through governmental agencies to supply necessary funds to contractors, subcontractors, and others engaged in such war production pursuant to such contracts;
Whereas the War Department, the Navy Department, and the Maritime Commission have available to them amounts appropriated by Congress which may be used for the purpose of making or guaranteeing loans, discounts or advances, or commitments in connection therewith for the purpose of financing contractors, subcontractors, and others engaged in such production or otherwise to expedite war production;
Whereas the guaranteeing or making of such loans, discounts, advances, and commitments by the War Department, Navy Department, and Maritime Commission will be expedited and facilitated by utilizing in this connection the Federal Reserve Banks and the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, which are agencies of the Government exercising functions in connection with the prosecution of the war effort and which have offices and other facilities, including experienced personnel, located conveniently throughout the country and are in close and frequent contact with banking and other financing institutions; and
Whereas the guaranteeing or making of such loans, discounts, advances, and commitments will greatly facilitate the participation of small business enterprises in war production;
Now, Therefore, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the various provisions of the First War Powers Act, 1941, approved December 18, 1942, by all other Acts of Congress, and by the Constitution of the United States, and as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, and deeming that such action will facilitate the prosecution of the war, I do hereby order as follows:
