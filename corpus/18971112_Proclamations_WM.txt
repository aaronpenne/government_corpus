A Proclamation
 
Whereas satisfactory proof has been given me that vessels of the United States in ballast which proceed to Mexico with the object of devoting themselves to pearl fishery and fishing on the Mexican coasts or for the purpose of receiving and carrying passengers and mail or of loading cattle, wood, or any other Mexican product and which shall go directly to ports open to general commerce so that thence they may be dispatched to their destination, and steam vessels of the United States are exempted from tonnage duties in Mexican ports;
Now, therefore, I, William McKinley, President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by the act of Congress approved July 24, 1897, entitled "An act to authorize the President to suspend discriminating duties imposed on foreign vessels and commerce," do hereby declare and proclaim that from and after the date of this, my proclamation, Mexican vessels in ballast which proceed to the United States with the object of fishing on the coast thereof or for the purpose of receiving and carrying passengers and mail or of loading cattle, wood, or any other product of the United States and which shall go directly to ports open to general commerce so that thence they may be despatched to their destination, and Mexican steam vessels shall be exempted from the payment of the tonnage duties imposed by section 4219 of the Revised Statutes of the United States.
And this proclamation shall remain in force and effect until otherwise ordered by the President of the United States.
In witness whereof I have set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be hereunto affixed.
Done at the city of Washington this 12th day of November, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and ninety-seven, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-second.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY
