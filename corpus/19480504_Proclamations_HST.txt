 On December 16, 1947 by Proclamation 2761A the President proclaimed such modifications of existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States of America and such continuance of existing customs or excise treatment of articles important into the United States of America as were then found to be required or appropriate to carry out said trade agreement on and after January 1, 1948 (12 F.R. 8866), which proclamation has been supplemented by Proclamation 2769 of January 30, 1948  (13 F.R. 467) and Proclamation 2782 of April 22, 1948 (13 F.R. 2211);
Whereas,

Whereas,
 I determine that it is required that the concessions represented by the second item 212 and the third item 1503 in party I of schedule XX of said general agreement shall be applied as if the portions of said section item 212 relating to the subdescription starting "Other (except hotel", and said third item 1503, were stated as follows:

Whereas, 
 The rates of duty in the first item 765 and the third item 1513 in the 9th recital of said proclamation of January 1, 1948 were inadvertently misstated, and I determine that it is required or appropriate to carry out said exclusive trade agreement specified in the 3rd recital of this proclamation that the rate in said first item 765 be changed to "1.6 cents per lb." and the rate in said third item 1513 be changed to "28% ad val."; and
