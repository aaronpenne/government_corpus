By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to Section 101(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(a)), I determined that certain existing duties and other import restrictions of the United States and of foreign countries were unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States and that one or more of the purposes stated in Section 2 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2102) would be promoted by entering into the trade agreements identified in the third and fourth recitals of this proclamation. 2. Sections 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, and 161(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2151, 2152, 2153, 2154, 2155, and 2211(b)) and Section 4(c) of Executive Order No. 11846 of March 27, 1975, (3 CFR 1971-1975 Comp. 974) (set out below), have been complied with. 3. Pursuant to Section 101(a)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(a)(1)), I, through my duly empowered representative, 
(1) 
on July 11, 1979, entered into a trade agreement with other contracting parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (61 Stat. (pts. 5 and 6)), as amended (the General Agreement), with countries seeking to accede to the General Agreement, and the European Economic Community, which agreement consists of the Geneva (1979) Protocol to the General Agreement, including a schedule of United States concessions annexed thereto (hereinafter referred to as "Schedule XX (Geneva-1979)"), a copy of which Geneva (1979) Protocol (including Schedule XX (Geneva-1979) annexed thereto) is annexed to this proclamation as Part 1 of Annex I (set out below), 
(2) 
on November 18, 1978, entered into a trade agreement with the Hungarian People's Republic, including a schedule of United States concessions annexed thereto, a copy of which agreement, and schedule, is annexed to this proclamation as Part 2 of Annex I (set out below),
(3) 
on October 31, 1979, entered into a trade agreement with the United Mexican States, which agreement consists of an exchange of letters, one enclosing a schedule of United States concessions, a copy of which exchange of letters, including such enclosed schedule, is annexed to this proclamation as Part 3 of Annex I (set out below), and
(4) 
on March 2, 1979, entered into a trade agreement with the Socialist Republic of Romania, which agreement consists of an exchange of letters, one enclosing a schedule of United States concessions, a copy of which exchange of letters, including such enclosed schedule, is annexed to this proclamation as Part 4 of Annex I (set out below), and on October 24, 1979, the American Institute in Taiwan entered into a trade agreement with the Coordination Council for North American Affairs (see the Taiwan Relations Act, Sections 4(b)(1), 6(a)(1), and 10(a), 93 Stat. 15, 17, and 18 (22 U.S.C. 3303(b)(1), 3305(a)(1), and 3309(a)), E.O. 12143, sections 1-203 and 1-204, 44 Fed. Reg. 37191) (former 22 U.S.C. 3301 note), which agreement consists of an exchange of letters, one enclosing a schedule of the United States concessions, a copy of which exchange of letters, including such enclosed schedule, is annexed to this proclamation as Part 5 of Annex I (set out below). 4. Pursuant to Section 102 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2112), I have determined that barriers to (and other distortions of) international trade were unduly burdening and restricting the foreign trade of the United States, and, through the Special Representative for Trade Negotiations (now United States Trade Representative, see Change of Name note above) (the Special Representative (now Trade Representative)), I have consulted with the appropriate Committees of the Congress, notified the House of Representatives and the Senate of my intention to enter into the agreements identified in Section 2(c) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 148) (19 U.S.C. 2503(c)), transmitted to the Congress copies of such agreements (a copy of one of which agreements, with the Hungarian People's Republic, is annexed to this proclamation as Part 6 of Annex I (set out below)), together with a draft of an implementing bill and a statement of administrative action, and such implementing bill, approving the agreements and the proposed administrative action, has been enacted into law (Section 2(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) (19 U.S.C. 2503(a))). 5.
(a) 
Pursuant to Section 502 of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251) (Pub. L. 96-39, July 26, 1979), I have determined that appropriate concessions have been received from foreign countries under trade agreements entered into under Title I of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111 et seq.); 
(b) 
Pursuant to Section 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 267), I have determined that duty-free treatment for certain articles now classified in the items of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (19 U.S.C. 1202) (TSUS) (see Publication of Tariff Schedules note under section 1202 of this title) listed in, and certified pursuant to, Section 601(a)(2) of that Act (93 Stat. 267), will provide treatment comparable to that provided by foreign countries under the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft; 
(c) 
Pursuant to Section 503(a)(2)(A) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251), I have determined, after providing interested parties an opportunity to comment, that each article identified in Annex IV to this proclamation (see note below) is not import sensitive; 
(d) 
Pursuant to Section 855(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 295), I have determined that adequate reciprocal concessions have been received, under trade agreements entered into under the Trade Act of 1974 (this chapter), for the application of the rate of duty appearing in rate column numbered 1 on January 1, 1979, for the comparable item on a proof gallon basis in the case of alcoholic beverages classified in all items in subpart D of part 12 of schedule 1 of the TSUS, except items 168.09, 168.12, 168.43, 168.77, 168.81, 168.87, and 168.95 (see Publication of Tariff Schedules note under section 1202 of this title); 
(e) 
Pursuant to Section 2(b)(2)(A) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) (19 U.S.C. 2503(b)(2)(A)), I have determined that obligations substantially the same as those applicable to developing countries set forth in the agreements listed in Section 2(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5) of that Act (93 Stat. 148) (19 U.S.C. 2503(c)(1), (2), (3), (4), and (5)) will be observed in Taiwan. 6. Each modification of existing duty proclaimed herein which provides with respect to an article for a decrease in duty below the limitation specified in Sections 101(b)(1) or 109(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(b)(1) or 2119(a)), and each modification of any other import restriction or tariff provision so proclaimed is authorized by one or more of the following provisions or statutes: 
(a) 
Section 101(b)(2) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111(b)(2)), by virtue of the fact that the rate of duty existing on January 1, 1975, applicable to the article was not more than 5 percent ad valorem (or ad valorem equivalent); 
(b) 
Section 109(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2119(b)), by virtue of the fact that I have determined, pursuant to that section, that the decrease authorized by that section will simplify the computation of the amount of duty imposed with respect to the article; 
(c) 
Sections 503(a)(2)(A) and 503(a)(3) to (6) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251 and 252) (Pub. L. 96-39, July 26, 1979) by virtue of the fact that they permit departures from the staging provisions of Section 109(a) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2119(a)); 
(d) 
Sections 502(a), 855(a), and 601(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 251, 295, and 267) by virtue of the authority in such sections for specified concessions based on reciprocity, but in the case of the last such section only after the conditions for acceptance of the Agreement on Trade in Civil Aircraft, identified in Section 2(c)(10) of that Act (93 Stat. 148) (19 U.S.C. 2503(c)(10)), are fulfilled; 
(e) 
Sections 505 through 513, inclusive, of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 252-257) by virtue of the fact that they permit exceeding the limitations specified in Sections 101 or 109 of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2111 or 2119); 
(f) 
Section 255 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962 (19 U.S.C. 1885) by virtue of the fact that it permits termination of proclamations issued pursuant to authority contained in that act; 
(g) 
Section 2(a) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 147) (19 U.S.C. 2503(a)) by virtue of its approval of the agreements identified in Section 2(c) of that Act (93 Stat. 148) (19 U.S.C. 2503(c)), and 
(h) 
Section 304(a)(3)(J) of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3)(J)) and Section 602(f) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2101 note), by virtue of the fact that I have found that the effectiveness of the proviso to Section 304(a)(3)(J) (19 U.S.C. 1304(a)(3)(J)) with respect to the marking of articles provided for in headnote 2 of part 1 of schedule 2 of the TSUS (see Publication of Tariff Schedules note under section 1202 of this title) is required or appropriate to carry out the first agreement identified in the third recital of this proclamation. 7. In the case of each decrease in duty, including those of the type specified in clause (a) or (b) of the sixth recital of this proclamation, which involves the determination of the ad valorem equivalent of a specific or compound rate of duty, and in the case of each modification in the form of an import duty, the United States International Trade Commission determined, pursuant to Section 601(4) of the Trade Act of 1974 (19 U.S.C. 2481(4)) in accordance with Section 4(e) of Executive Order No. 11846 of March 27, 1975, (3 CFR 1971-1975 Comp. 973) (set out below), and at my direction, the ad valorem equivalent of the specific or compound rate, on the basis of the value of imports of the article concerned during a period determined by it to be representative, utilizing, to the extent practicable, the standards of valuation contained in Sections 402 and 402a of the Tariff Act of 1930 (19 U.S.C. 1401a and 1402) applicable to the article during such representative period. 8. Pursuant to the Trade Act of 1974 (this chapter) and the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (see 19 U.S.C. 2501), I determine that the modification or continuance of existing duties or other import restrictions or the continuance of existing duty-free or excise treatment hereinafter proclaimed is required or appropriate to carry out the trade agreements identified in the third recital of this proclamation or one or more of the trade agreements identified in Section 2(c) of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (93 Stat. 148) (19 U.S.C. 2503(c)). 9. Following unsatisfactory negotiations with the European Economic Community under Articles XXIV:6 and XXVIII of the General Agreement regarding the maintenance by the European Economic Community of unreasonable import restrictions upon imports of poultry from the United States, the President, by Proclamation 3564 of December 4, 1963 (77 Stat. 1035), suspended certain United States tariff concessions; as a result of the reciprocal concessions contained in the Geneva (1979) Protocol to the General Agreement, I determine that the termination of such suspension of tariff concessions contained in Proclamation 3564 (except those applicable to automobile trucks valued at $1,000 or more (provided for in TSUS item 692.02) (see Publication of Tariff Schedules note under section 1202 of this title)) is required to carry out the General Agreement. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes, including but not limited to Title I and Section 604 of the Trade Act of 1974 (this subchapter and 19 U.S.C. 2483), Section 2 (19 U.S.C. 2503), and Titles V, VI, and VIII of the Trade Agreements Act of 1979 (Pub.
