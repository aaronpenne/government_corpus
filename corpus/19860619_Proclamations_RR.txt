By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The American farmer is the most productive in the world. Citizens from virtually every nation rely on our farmers for food and fiber for nourishment and for clothing. This Administration is firmly dedicated to developing, maintaining, and expanding international markets for United States' agricultural exports. 
Agriculture is the single largest export industry in the United States. Earnings from agricultural exports have contributed $333 billion to the United States balance of payments in the past decade, and these earnings have stimulated additional employment and investment estimated at $1 trillion. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 310, has designated the week of June 15, 1986, through June 21, 1986, as "National Agricultural Export Week," and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of June 15, 1986, through June 21, 1986, as National Agricultural Export Week, and I call upon the people of the United States to commemorate this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 19th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
