A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 April 14, 1952, will mark the sixty-second anniversary of the founding of the Pan American Union, keystone of the Organization of American States, of which it is the Permanent Organ and General Secretariat; and
Whereas
 April 14 is customarily observed throughout the Americas as "Pan American Day"; and
Whereas
 the Charter of the Organization of American States came into full legal effect on December 13, 1951, furnishing a treaty basis for the Organization; and
Whereas
 the determination of the republics of this Hemisphere to achieve a greater solidarity and a more perfect expression of their mutual efforts to withstand aggression, to preserve peace, and to promote their economic, social, and cultural development has thus been solemnized in a lasting pact:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Monday, April 14, 1952, as Pan American Day, and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations for the observance of Pan American Day; and I urge all interested organizations, and the people generally, to unite in suitable ceremonies commemorative of the founding of the Pan American Union, thereby testifying to the close bonds of friendship existing between the peoples of the United States and of the other American republics.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-sixth.
