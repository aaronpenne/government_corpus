Andrew Johnson, President of the United States of America
 
To all whom it may concern:
 
Whereas the exequatur of Claudius Edward Habicht, recognizing him as consul of Sweden and Norway at New York, and that of S. M. Svenson as vice-consul of Sweden and Norway at New Orleans were formally revoked on the 26th day of March last; and
Whereas representations have been made to me since that date which have effectually relieved those gentlemen from the charges of unlawful and unfriendly conduct heretofore entertained against them:
Now, therefore, be it known that I, Andrew Johnson, President of the United States of America, do hereby annul the revocation of the exequaturs of the said Claudius Edward Habicht and S. M. Svenson and restore to them the right to exercise the functions and privileges heretofore granted as consular officers of the Government of Sweden and Norway.
In testimony whereof I have hereunto signed my name and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done at the city of Washington, this 30th day of May, A. D. 1866, and of the Independence of the United States the ninetieth.
ANDREW JOHNSON.
By the President:
WILLIAM H. SEWARD,
 Secretary of State.
