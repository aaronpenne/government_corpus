By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 satisfactory proof has been given to me by the Government of Cuba that no discriminating duties of tonnage or imposts are imposed or levied in the ports of Cuba, upon vessels wholly belonging to citizens of the United States or upon the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in the same from the United States, or from any foreign country:
Now, Therefore, I, Theodore Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 4228 of the Revised Statutes of the United States, do hereby declare and proclaim that, from and after the date of this, my Proclamation, so long as vessels of the United States and their cargoes shall be exempt from discriminating duties as aforesaid, any such duties on Cuban vessels entering the ports of the United States, or on the produce, manufactures, or merchandise imported in such vessels, shall be suspended and discontinued, and no longer.
In testimony whereof, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the city of Washington, the third day of July, A.D. 1902, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and twenty-sixth.
THEODORE ROOSEVELT
By the President:
JOHN HAY,
 Secretary of State.
