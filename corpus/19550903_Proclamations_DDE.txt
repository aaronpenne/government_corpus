A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 opportunity for employment should not be denied any qualified person merely because of a physical handicap; and
Whereas
 an individual's ability—not his disability—should be the first consideration in determining his capacity for employment; and
Whereas
 the Nation's program under the Vocational Rehabilitation Amendments of 1954 (68 Stat. 652) will greatly increase the number of Americans rehabilitated annually; and
Whereas
 it is imperative that jobs be provided through the public employment service and other channels so that disabled veterans and other handicapped men and women can become active and participating members of the Nation's working force; and
Whereas
 the Department of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Department of Labor, and the President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped are cooperating with governors' committees in the States and Territories in a joint public-education program to rehabilitate and hire the handicapped; and
Whereas
 the observance of National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week once each year, as authorized by the joint resolution of the Congress approved August 11, 1945 (59 Stat. 530), emphasizes the need for a year-round program:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do call upon the people of our Nation to observe the week beginning October 2, 1955, as National Employ the Physically Handicapped Week, and to cooperate with the President's Committee on Employment of the Physically Handicapped in carrying out the aforementioned resolution of the Congress.
I also urge the governors of States, mayors of municipalities, other public officials, leaders of industry and labor, and members of religious, civic, veterans', agricultural, women's, handicapped persons', and fraternal organizations to participate actively in this observance.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this third day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eightieth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
