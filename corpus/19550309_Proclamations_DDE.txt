A Proclamation
 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended (7 U.S.C. 624), I issued a proclamation on June 8, 1953 (No. 3019; 67 Stat. c46) limiting the quantities of peanuts, whether shelled, not shelled, blanched, salted, prepared, or preserved (including roasted peanuts, but not including peanut butter) which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption in any 12-month period beginning July 1 in any year, which proclamation was amended by my proclamation of June 30, 1953 (No. 3025; 67 Stat. c54);
Whereas
 the total quantity of such peanuts which may be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption under the said proclamation of June 8, 1953, as amended, during the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1954, has already been entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption;
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 (d) of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, the United States Tariff Commission has made a supplemental investigation to determine whether there is need for an additional quantity of imported peanuts during the remainder of the quota year ending June 30, 1955, to meet essential requirements of domestic peanut users, and, if so, what additional quantity might be permitted to be entered during the current quota year without materially interfering with or rendering ineffective the peanut program of the United States Department of Agriculture;
Whereas
 the United States Tariff Commission has submitted to me a report of its findings and recommendation made in connection with the said supplemental investigation;
Whereas
, on the basis of the said supplemental investigation and report of the Tariff Commission, I find that changed circumstances require the modification of the existing quota restrictions on peanuts which are in effect for the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1954, pursuant to the said proclamation of June 8, 1953, as amended, so as to permit the additional quantity of peanuts hereinafter described to be entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the remainder of the quota period ending June 30, 1955, subject to the fee hereinafter proclaimed; and
Whereas
 I find and declare that the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption of such additional quantity of such peanuts subject to such fee will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said program of the Department of Agriculture with respect to peanuts, nor reduce substantially the amount of products processed in the United States from peanuts with respect to which such program is being undertaken:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that the said proclamation of June 8, 1953, as amended by the said proclamation of June 30, 1953, is hereby modified so as to permit the entry, or withdrawal from warehouse, for consumption during the remainder of the 12-month period beginning July 1, 1954, of not more than 51,000,000 pounds (aggregate quantity) of peanuts, shelled, blanched, salted, prepared, or preserved (including roasted peanuts, but not including peanuts not shelled or peanut butter), of sizes averaging in representative samples more than 40 kernels per ounce, subject to a fee of 2 cents per pound but not more than 50 per centum ad valorem: Provided, That the said fee shall be in addition to any other duties imposed on the importation of such peanuts.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 9th day of March in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-ninth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
