A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United States recognizes that international commerce through reciprocal world trade is a principal means to peace and prosperity; and 
Whereas
 a successful United States commercial-policy requires the profitable sale of United States goods in other countries to insure a favorable balance of international payments; and 
Whereas
 the great American marketplace must meet, encourage, and welcome competitive challenges from the vigorous new nations not only to achieve a favorable balance of payments but also to serve as inspiration and strength for all countries; and 
Whereas
, although increasing the sale of United States goods abroad is vital to the United States domestic economy, private enterprise must nevertheless continue to practice the fundamental American belief that initiative and competition in business must be exercised with responsibility and morality toward all people: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America., do hereby proclaim the week beginning May 19, 1963, as World Trade Week; and I request the appropriate Federal, State, and local officials to cooperate in the observance of that week. 
I also urge business, labor, agriculture, educational and civic groups, as well as the people of the United States generally, to observe World Trade Week with gatherings, discussions, exhibits, ceremonies, and other appropriate activities designed to promote continuing awareness of the importance of world trade to our economy and our relations with other nations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twentieth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
