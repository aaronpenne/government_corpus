Whereas Proclamations having been issued by me declaring the neutrality of the United States of America in the wars now existing between various European nations; and 
Whereas it is desirable to take precautions to insure the enforcement of said Proclamations in so far as the use of radio communication is concerned; 
It is now ordered, by virtue of authority vested in me to establish regulations on the subject, that all radio stations within the jurisdiction of the United States of America are hereby prohibited from transmitting or receiving for delivery messages of an unneutral nature, and from in any way rendering to any one of the belligerents any unneutral service, during the continuance of hostilities. 
The enforcement of this order is hereby delegated to the Secretary of the Navy, who is authorized and directed to take such action in the premises as to him may appear necessary. 
This order to take effect from and after this date.
