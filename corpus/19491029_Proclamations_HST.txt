A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 within a single generation the two most devastating wars in human history brought death or despair to millions; and
Whereas
 the signing of the World War I Armistice on November 11, 1918, aroused in the hearts of men the ardent hope of a peace that would endure for all time; and
Whereas
 after the second holocaust men still desperately seek the goal of international accord which stirred their hearts in 1918; and
Whereas
 the Congress passed a concurrent resolution on June 4, 1926 (44 Stat. 1982), providing for the observance of the anniversary of November 11, 1918, and by an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), the Congress stipulated that November 11 of each year should, as a legal holiday, be dedicated to the cause of world peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to celebrate Friday, November 11, 1949, as Armistice Day by recalling to mind the valor not only of those who brought victory to the Allied banners on November 11, 1918, but also of those who refought freedom's battle for the succeeding generation.
And I invite our citizens to rededicate themselves on November 11, at ceremonies to be held in schools, churches, and other suitable places, to the cause of peace throughout the world. I also direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fourth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
