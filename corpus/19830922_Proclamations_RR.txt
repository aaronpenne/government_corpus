By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The activities of American businesswomen have experienced a dramatic transition and expansion in recent years. More and more women are participating in every aspect of businessâ€”as owners, executives, professionals, support staff and production workers. 
Women play an increasingly important role in the Nation's economy and in determining and implementing the direction of both the private and public sectors of our Nation. Women entrepreneurs currently are the fastest growing segment of the small business community, owning twenty-two percent of all sole proprietorships and realizing gross receipts of over $40 billion. Women own businesses as diverse as coal mining, construction, manufacturing, and wholesale and retail trade. 
With more options and choices available to them, women are realizing their potential as a vital force in the American economy. 
In recognition that businesswomen are increasingly influencing the growth of our economy and the direction of our Nation, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 18 (Public Law 98-55), has designated September 22, 1983, as "American Business Women's Day" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of that day. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 22, 1983, as American Business Women's Day. I call upon every American to join me in observing this day with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 22nd day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
