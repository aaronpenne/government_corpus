By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Clean water can mean many thingsâ€”a sparkling stream, a refreshing drink, an industrial essential or a beleaguered resource.
The need for clean water always exists. Agencies of government, researchers in universities, and concerned citizens individually and through organizations are working to assure a reliable and plentiful supply. Our heightened awareness of its importance in our lives and in our national life is a safeguard for its protection and enhancement. It is appropriate that we recognize the efforts of all those who are seeking to preserve our clean water supplies and encourage them and all our citizens to continue their quest.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, in concurrence with H.J. Res. 437, do hereby designate the week beginning April 15, 1973, as National Clean Water Week. I call upon Federal, State, and local officials to support National Clean Water Week and to arrange for its proper observance. I also ask that special attention be given to personal voluntary activities and education efforts directed toward recognizing the need for clean water and protecting the supply.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this fourteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-seventh.
RICHARD NIXON
