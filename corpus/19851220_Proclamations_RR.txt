By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to section 502(b) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2462(b)), as amended, and section 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2483), I have determined that it is appropriate to provide for the termination of preferential treatment under the Generalized System of Preferences (GSP) for articles which are currently eligible for such treatment and which are imported from Portugal. Such termination is the result of the accession of Portugal to the European Economic Community. 
2. Section 502(b) of the Trade Act specifies that member states of the European Economic Community are ineligible for such preferential treatment under the GSP. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States of America, including but not limited to sections 502(b) and 604 of the Trade Act, do proclaim that: 
(1) General headnote 3(e)(v)(A) to the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), listing those countries whose products are eligible for benefits of the GSP, is amended by striking out "Portugal." 
(2) No article the product of Portugal and imported into the United States after the effective date of this proclamation shall be eligible for preferential treatment under the GSP. 
(3) The modifications to the TSUS made by this proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles both: (1) imported on or after January 1, 1976, and (2) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after January 1, 1986. 
In Witness Whereof I have hereunto set my hand this 20th day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
