By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
It is appropriate that Americans express our appreciation to the many thousands of dedicated men and women in all parts of our Nation who have devoted their lives to helping those in need. For more than a century, social workers have been committed to the betterment and general welfare of all our society. They have helped implement social services with creativity, resourcefulness, and true professionalism. 
It is within our local communities that the real contribution to the welfare of our citizens is made. Those closest to the problem-the social workers in State and local governments, area agencies, and private and voluntary organizationsâ€”are usually the most qualified persons to decide what help is needed and the best way to provide it. In this way, they carry on and enhance our proud American heritage of neighbors helping neighbors, and people helping people. 
In recognition of the many contributions of the social work profession to the welfare of our society, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 112, has authorized and requested the President to proclaim the month of March 1984, as "National Social Work Month." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of March 1984, as National Social Work Month. I ask all our citizens to join in this recognition and to search their hearts for ways in which they too can help their fellow Americans. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
