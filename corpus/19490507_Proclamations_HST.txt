A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the economic welfare and the national security of the United States are strengthened by our Merchant Marine; and
Whereas
 deficiencies in the Merchant Marine are now being overcome by the construction of the first passenger vessels to be built in this country since the end of hostilities in World War II; and
Whereas
 the present role of marine transportation invests with momentous significance the feat of the steamship Savannah, which sailed from Savannah, Georgia, on May 22, 1819, on the first successful transoceanic voyage under steam propulsion; and
Whereas
 the Congress, by a joint resolution approved May 20, 1933 (48 Stat. 73), designated May 22 as National Maritime Day in commemoration of that historic achievement and requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for the observance of the day; and
Whereas
 in the present year May 22 falls on Sunday, it is fitting and proper that the celebration of National Maritime Day take place on Monday, May 23:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our Merchant Marine on Monday, May 23, 1949, by flying the flag of the United States at their homes or other suitable places.
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag on all Government buildings, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship, on Monday, May 23, 1949, in honor of National Maritime Day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 7th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-third. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

DEAN ACHESON,
