By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
One of our most important national objectives is the establishment of a national food policy. This is vital to our own welfare and security as well as to our search for world peace. It requires the mutual respect and intelligent cooperation of all our people. 
Once each family's farm supplied almost all of the raw materials and finished products to feed, clothe and warm the family. As our means of production have progressed and farmers as well as factories and businesses have increasingly specialized, each family has come to depend on many others for the tools and equipment and materials to keep our complex system running and meet our individual daily needs. 
Our production of food is the marvel of the world. It depends on not only our farmers, but also researchers, the makers and sellers of equipment and supplies and the providers of services to farms and farmers, and those who transport, process and sell our harvests. All are vital links in maintaining the wholesomeness, abundance and availability at reasonable cost of our varied food supply. Many of the links in this food chain are in distant cities. All of us, on farms, in cities and suburbs, are consumers of these vital products.
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of November 18 through November 24, 1977, as National Farm-City Week and ask all Americans to observe that period with suitable activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
