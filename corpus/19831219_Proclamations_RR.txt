By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Voluntarism is a uniquely American tradition. The concept is as old as our Nation itself. It was individuals working towards dreams, visions, and hopes that created this country. Today, that vitality still exists, as manifested in the large number of private initiative and volunteer efforts in which Americans strive to improve the lives of their fellow citizens. People from all walks of life; of all ages, races, and income levels; members of business and labor; and community organizations of all types are contributing their share in partnerships with neighbors and friends to help others. 
In this holiday season and time of giving, I call upon all Americans to reflect this spirit of generosity and private initiative by providing additional food to those in need. I enlist the aid of each American who is able to donate an item of food for the needy. In addition, I strongly urge those in the food industry to donate and distribute extra food to food banks, so that this effort may complement the government programs which are providing unprecedented levels of total food assistance to low-income Americans. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim December 19, 1983, as National Care and Share Day and call upon the people of the United States to pay tribute to acts of charitable voluntarism and to promote community involvement in caring for the needs of our neighbors. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 19th day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eighth.
RONALD REAGAN
