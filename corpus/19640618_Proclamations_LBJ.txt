Whereas
 the joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212) authorizes and requests the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation each year designating the third week in July as "Captive Nations Week" until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world; and 
Whereas
 the cause of human rights and personal dignity remains a universal aspiration; and 
Whereas
 this nation is firmly committed to the cause of freedom and justice every where; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate and proper to manifest to the people of the captive nations the support of the Government and the people of the United States of America, for their just aspirations: 
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 12, 1964, as Captive Nations Week. 
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to give renewed devotion to the just aspirations of all people for national independence and human liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this eighteenth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
