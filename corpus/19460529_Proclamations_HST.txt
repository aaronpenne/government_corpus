A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 on June 14, 1777, the Continental Congress adopted the flag which we cherish as the flag of the United States of America; and
Whereas
 under this flag generations of Americans have lived and worked to establish the foundations of our country's greatness; and
Whereas
 this flag has become the beloved symbol of our way of life, our achievements as a people, and the many blessings which Providence has heaped upon us; and
Whereas
 for many years it has been customary to observe the anniversary of the day of the adoption of the flag as Flag Day; and
Whereas
 in this year following our great victories on the field of battle it is especially appropriate that we continue the customary observance of this day, and dedicate ourselves with renewed devotion to the responsibilities and obligations of citizenship under this flag:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate June 14, 1946, as Flag Day, and direct that the flag of the United States be displayed on all Government buildings on that day.
And I urge that the people of the United States observe that day by suitable public ceremonies and by the display of the flag at their homes and other appropriate places; and I suggest that, in recognition of the joint victories achieved by the United States and her allies, the flags of the United Nations be shown, wherever possible, in the company of the flag of the United States.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 29th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES F. BYRNES,
