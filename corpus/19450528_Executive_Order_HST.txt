WHEREAS after an investigation I find and proclaim that the plants and facilities of the Gaffney Manufacturing Company, located at Gaffney, South Carolina, are equipped for the manufacture and production of articles and materials that are required for the war effort, or that are useful in connection therewith; that there are existing interruptions of the operation of said plants and facilities as a result of a labor disturbance; that the war effort will be unduly impeded or delayed by such interruptions; and that eh exercise, as hereinafter specified, of the powers vested in me is necessary to insure, in the interests of the war effort, the operation of these plants and facilities;
NOW, THEREFORE, by the virtue of the power and authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including Section 9 of the Selective Training and Service Act of 1940 (54 Stat. 892), as amended by the War Labor Disputes Act (57 Stat. 163), as President of the United States and Commander in Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States, it is here by ordered as follows:

4. Possession, control, and operation of any plant or facility, or part thereof, taken under this Order, shall be terminated by the Secretary of War within 60 days after he determines that the productive efficiency of the plant, facility, or part thereof prevailing prior to the existing interruptions of production, referred to in the recitals of this Order, has been restored.
