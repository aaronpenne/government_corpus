A Proclamation
 
Standardized for use in the United States in 1932, braille is the primary tactile system for reading and writing used by blind individuals today. The braille system uses raised dots to represent the letters of the alphabet, symbols of punctuation, mathematic and scientific characters, music and computer notation, and foreign language signs. 
Through braille, a person who is visually impaired is given the key to unlock the power of the written word. Braille enables blind individuals to achieve the many rewards of literacy, including educational advancement, personal independence, and economic opportunity and security. Braille also enables its users to enjoy the full form, structure, and beauty of printed poetry and prose. 
Over the past 60 years, the braille system has continued to open doors of learning and opportunity for blind Americans. This week we acknowledge the importance of braille and recognize the many dedicated individuals who teach and promote this system as a tool of achievement. 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 353, has designated the week of January 3 through January 9, 1993, as "Braille Literacy Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this week. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week of January 3 through January 9, 1993, as Braille Literacy Week and invite all Americans to observe this week with appropriate programs and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this fifth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and ninety-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and seventeenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
