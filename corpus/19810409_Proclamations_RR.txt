By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
To the People of the United States: 
With sadness, I announce the death of General of the Army Omar Nelson Bradley, who died yesterday in New York City. 
For sixty-nine years General Bradley wore the colors of an American soldier-with courage, integrity, professionalism and, above all, honor. Even as he rose in rank, humility never left his side. He was the "G.I.'s General" because he Was, always, a G.I. 
In World War II his conspicuously brilliant leadership thrust him to the top of the U.S. military command. Whether at Normandy, North Africa, or Sicily, the Bradley command always meant good fortune for freedom's defenders. 
General Bradley's memory will be revered by his countrymen. He left to us exemplary qualities that long will be the standard of every soldier who takes the solemn pledge to defend this Nation. 
As a mark of respect for the memory of General Bradley, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff upon all public buildings and grounds, at all military posts and naval stations, and on all naval vessels of the Federal Government in the District of Columbia and throughout the United States and its Territories and possessions until his interment. I also direct that the flag shall be flown at half-staff for the same length of time at all United States embassies, legations, consular offices, and other facilities abroad, including all military facilities and naval vessels and stations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
