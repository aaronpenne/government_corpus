By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Productive people are our Nation's greatest natural resource. Americans are agreed on the importance of seeing that every child in our country gets a healthy start in life. Sound nutrition is a vital building block in our children's growth and development. Malnutrition must not be allowed to harm the development of any American child. 
Thirty years ago, we demonstrated our concern for our children's well-being with the inauguration of the National School Lunch Program. Through it, millions of children have received the benefit of improved nutrition, and therefore a better opportunity for full, healthy development. 
The National School Lunch Program exemplifies the cooperative spirit that underscores the efforts of food producers and distributors, dietitians, educators, parents, civic groups and public officials at all levels of Government to ensure the health and welfare of our Nation's youngsters. 
In recognition of the Program's contribution to America's youth, the Congress, by a joint resolution of October 9, 1962 (76 Stat. 779; 36 U.S.C. 168), has designated the week beginning the second Sunday of October in each year as National School Lunch Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for its appropriate observance. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe the week of October 10, 1976, as National School Lunch Week and to give special recognition to the role of good nutrition in building a stronger America through its youth. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first. 
GERALD R. FORD
