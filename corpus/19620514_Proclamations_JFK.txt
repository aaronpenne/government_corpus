A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 transportation has been of enormous significance in the settlement and growth of large areas of the United States; and 
Whereas
 an efficient and dynamic transportation system is vital to the continued economic growth, productivity, and progress of our Nation; and 
Whereas
 the promotion and development of an efficient transportation system are responsibilities of the Government, users of transportation, and labor and management; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 628, approved May 14, 1962, has requested the President to proclaim annually the week in May of each year in which falls the third Friday of that month as National Transportation Week, as a tribute to the men and women who, night and day, move goods and people throughout our land: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 13, 1962, as National Transportation Week; and I urge all our people to join in appropriate activities and ceremonies with the various branches of the transportation industry and representatives of governmental agencies in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the people of each community to recognize the vital role which the transportation industry plays in our economy and in our daily lives. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fourteenth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-sixth.
