By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
April 20, 1982 marks the 125th Anniversary of the American Institute of Architects. With a spirit of appreciation, the American people honor and congratulate the Institute for its many accomplishments. 
American architects have historically expressed through their work the richness of our heritage and the vitality of our national spirit. They have combined advances in building technology with design innovation to give exciting new forms to our cities. The architectural profession, through its Institute, has been especially vigilant in its stewardship of many of the Nation's architectural treasures, including the monuments, buildings, majestic avenues and green spaces of the Federal City of Washington, D.C. 
The Senate has, by Senate Joint Resolution 169, recognized the unique contribution made by this honored profession and has requested me to designate April 18 through April 24, 1982, as National Architecture Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 18 through April 24, 1982 as National Architecture Week. I call upon the people of the United States and all government agencies to observe the week with appropriate ceremonies and activities paying tribute to the Architects of America in this, the one hundred and twenty-fifth year of the existence of the American Institute of Architects. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and sixth.
RONALD REAGAN
