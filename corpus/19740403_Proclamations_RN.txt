By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Since the beginning of our Nation, maritime enterprise has helped to forge the spirit of America and shape its destiny.
In our early years, our merchant marine was a major force in fostering our economic growth and defending our freedom. Down through the years, the American merchant marine continued to serve our economic aspirations and to assist our military forces in times of emergency.
Today, when the United States is the world leader in trade and military power, the dual roles of our merchant marine remain vital to the national interests.
Under the Merchant Marine Act of 1970, new generations of highly advanced and efficient ships are being introduced into our merchant fleet to reinforce America's presence in the world's shipping lanes and to insure that our maritime capacities remain equal to their challenges.
To promote public awareness of our maritime heritage, the Congress in 1933 (48 Stat. 73) designated the anniversary of the first transatlantic voyage by a steamship, the SAVANNAH, on May 22, 1819, as National Maritime Day, and requested the President to issue a proclamation annually in observance of that day.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard M. Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to honor our American merchant marine on May 22, 1974, by displaying the flag of the United States at their homes and other suitable places, and I request that all ships sailing under the American flag dress ship on that day.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-four, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-eighth.
RICHARD NIXON
