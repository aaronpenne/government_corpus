 To the Military Officers Commanding in West Tennessee:
 
While I can not order as within requested, allow me to say that it is my wish for you to relieve the people from all burdens, harassments and oppressions so far as is possible consistently with your military necessities; that the object of the war being to restore and maintain the blessings of peace and good government, I desire you to help, and not hinder, every advance in that direction.
Of your military necessities you must judge and execute, but please do so in the spirit and with the purpose above indicated.
ABRAHAM LINCOLN.
