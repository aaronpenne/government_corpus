Mr. Merrit O. Chance may be transferred from clerk to the Secretary of War to superintendent of post-office supplies in the Post-Office Department without taking a noncompetitive examination, in view of his having passed the examination for entrance to the classified service in the clerk grade, and because of his former service in the Post-Office Department and his general knowledge of postal affairs, which, it is believed, qualify him for the position of superintendent of post-office supplies.
