WHEREAS, there exist certain labor disputes between employers (or associations by which such employers are represented in collective bargaining conferences) who are (1) steamship companies operating ships or employed as agents for ships engaged in service from or to Atlantic, Pacific, Great Lakes and Gulf Coast ports of the United States, or from or to other ports of the United States or its territories or possessions, (2) contracting stevedores, (3) contracting marine carpenters, (4) lighterage operators, or (5) other employers engaged in related or associated pier activities, and certain of their employees represented by the International Longshoremen's Association, AFLâ€“CIO, and the International Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union; and
WHEREAS, such disputes have resulted in strikes on Pacific, Atlantic, Great Lakes and Gulf Coast ports of the United States which if permitted to continue will, in my opinion, affect a substantial part of the maritime industry, and industry engaged in trade, commerce, transportation, transmission, or communication among the several States and with foreign nations, and will imperil the national health and safety:
