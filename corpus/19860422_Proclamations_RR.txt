By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The accumulation of information, the acquisition of knowledge, and the application of that knowledge to solve problems or enhance life are principal functions of American education. At every level, school libraries offer a great range of resource materials that greatly enrich education and increase the knowledge and understanding of all Americans. 
Young people often develop a lifelong love of reading because of their exposure to books in school libraries. Furthermore, researchers are often motivated by the vast resources of university and special libraries as they dedicate themselves to studying the problems of society. School libraries and their dedicated staffs make an incalculable contribution to our educational system. 
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 52, has designated the month of April 1986 as "National School Library Month" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this occasion. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the month of April 1986 as National School Library Month. I invite the Governors of every State, principals, teachers, educators, students, parents, and all Americans to observe this month with appropriate activities to heighten the awareness of the importance of school libraries. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-second day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
