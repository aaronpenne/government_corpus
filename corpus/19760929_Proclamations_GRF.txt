By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Country music is a descriptive and entertaining chronicle of American life. The melodies and lyrics of a country song are drawn from the very heart of America and its people. 
The music reflects the joys and sorrows of daily life and it reminds us that truth, compassion and moral character should guide our actions and shape our beliefs. 
Country music is the spirit of America in song. It has grown in popularity among a wide range of people in all walks of life. It is a uniquely American art form which will flourish as long as the story of our Nation is the story of common people. It is fitting that we pay tribute to the music, to the hundreds of talented people who perform it and to the millions more who enjoy it. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, designate October 1976 as Country Music Month, and encourage all Americans to commemorate this designation with suitable observances. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first. 
GERALD R. FORD
