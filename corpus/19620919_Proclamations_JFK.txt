A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 we are deeply conscious of the debt we owe to the men and women of our Nation who served in our armed forces during times of conflict, thereby preserving our heritage of freedom and advancing the cause of world peace; and 
Whereas
 the continued devotion and adherence to the highest ideals of citizenship by our veterans has been inspirational to us in peacetime as well as in time of war; and 
Whereas
 the eleventh of November has been dedicated to the cause of world peace by the Congress and has been designated as a legal holiday to be known as Veterans Day (Act of May 13, 1938, 52 Stat. 351, as amended (5 U.S.C. 87a)): 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby invite my fellow citizens to join with me on Sunday, November 11, 1962, in observing Veterans Day by attending and participating in ceremonies which will demonstrate our continued desire for world peace and our heartfelt gratitude to our veterans whose service and sacrifice has advanced the cause of peace. 
I direct the appropriate officials of the Federal Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day. 
I also call upon officials of the Federal Government and of the State Governments, as well as upon local officials, to cooperate fully with the Veterans Day National Committee and interested patriotic organizations in their efforts to make clear to all our people the true significance of Veterans Day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this nineteenth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK,
