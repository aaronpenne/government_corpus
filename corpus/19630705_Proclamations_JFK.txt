A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 by a joint resolution approved July 17, 1959 (73 Stat. 212) the Congress has authorized and requested the President of the United States of America to issue a proclamation, designating the third week in July 1959 as "Captive Nations Week", and to issue a similar proclamation each year until such time as freedom and independence shall have been achieved for all the captive nations of the world; and 
Whereas
 the cause of human rights and dignity remains a universal aspiration and 
Whereas
 justice requires the elemental right of free choice and 
Whereas
 this nation has an abiding commitment to the principles of national self-determination and human freedom. 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning July 14, 1963, as Captive Nations Week. 
I invite the people of the United States of America to observe this week with appropriate ceremonies and activities, and I urge them to give renewed devotion to the just aspirations of all people for national independence and human liberty. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fifth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY
