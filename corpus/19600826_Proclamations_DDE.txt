A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the men and women who have served in our armed forces have contributed immeasurably to the preservation of America's freedom and to the advancement of the goal of world peace; and
Whereas
 the Nation is eternally grateful to our veterans for these contributions; and
Whereas
 it is fitting that we set aside a special day each year to honor our veterans and give nationwide expression of our esteem for them; and
Whereas
 the Congress by an act approved May 13, 1938 (52 Stat. 351), as amended by an act approved June 1, 1954 (68 Stat. 168), has declared November 11 of each year to be a legal holiday and has designated it as Veterans Day in honor of our veterans and as a day dedicated to the cause of world peace:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon all of our citizens to observe Friday, November 11, 1960, as Veterans Day. Let us celebrate that day with appropriate ceremonies not only in tribute to our veterans but also in rededication to the cause of peace with honor throughout the world.
I also direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Veterans Day.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-sixth day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
