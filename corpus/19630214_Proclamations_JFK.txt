A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 hundreds of thousands of rural volunteer leaders and 4-H Club members actively participate in organized farm, home, and highway safety programs; and 
Whereas
 these community, State, and national safety programs have proved effective in reducing the number and rate of accidents among farm people; and 
Whereas
 accidents nevertheless continue to kill or disable nearly a million farm residents annually, and cause needless suffering and economic waste to both the agricultural community and the Nation; and 
Whereas
 increased emphasis on the safety and productive efficiency of farm families is vital to assure a continuing abundance of food and fiber for the well-being of all Americans: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call on the people of the Nation to observe the week beginning July 21, 1963, as National Farm Safety Week; and I urge all farm families, and all persons and organizations allied with agriculture, to engage in a purposeful, united effort to reduce further the number of farm, home, and highway accidents. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this fourteenth day of February in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-seventh. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
GEORGE W. BALL, 
Acting Secretary of State
