By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and laws of the United States of America, including sections 3301 and 3302 of title 5 of the United States Code, it is hereby ordered as follows:
Section 1. An individual who is employed in a Professional or Administrative Career position under Schedule B under the authority of 5 C.F.R. 213.3202(1) may be converted noncompetitively to a career or career-conditional appointment at GS-9, provided the individual meets the qualifications and other requirements established by the Director of the Office of Personnel Management, and further provided the individual's performance is determined by the employing agency, in a careful and formal evaluation, to warrant such conversion at GS-9. 
Sec. 2. The Director of the Office of Personnel Management shall prescribe such regulations as may be necessary to implement this Order.
