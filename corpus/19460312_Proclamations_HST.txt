By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 Public Resolution 67 approved May 3, 1940 (54 Stat. 178), provides in part:
That the third Sunday in May each year be, and hereby is, set aside as Citizenship Day and that the President of the United States is hereby authorized and requested to issue annually a proclamation setting aside that day as a public occasion for the recognition of all who, by coming of age or naturalization, have attained the status of citizenship, and the day shall be designated as "I Am An American Day."
That the civil and educational authorities of States, counties, cities, and towns be, and they are hereby, urged to make plans for the proper observance of this day and for the full instruction of future citizens in their responsibilities and opportunities as citizens of the United States and of the States and localities in which they reside;
Whereas
 the part played by this nation in bringing full victory to the Allied Powers during the past year has been possible only because of the strength, the devotion, and the sacrifices of millions of our young men and women on the battlefronts of the world, performing bravely their highest duties as citizens;
Whereas
 our numerous citizens of foreign birth have shown loyalty and fidelity to their new citizenship in the performance of all the tasks which helped to bring the final and complete victory over the enemies of the country which these citizens have made their own by naturalization;
Whereas
 the nations of the world now look to the United States for leadership and for assistance, as they repair the devastation wrought by the war:
Whereas
 our nation derives its chief strength to give leadership and assistance from the fact that its citizens, young and old, native-born and foreign-born, work together as one people; and
Whereas
 this year new thousands have entered upon the full responsibilities of citizenship either by reaching their majority or by naturalization:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, pursuant to the aforesaid public resolution do hereby designate Sunday, May 19, 1946, as "I Am An American Day," and do set that day aside as a public occasion for the honoring of American citizenship by giving special recognition to all our citizens who have recently become full members of the body politic.
And I urge Federal, State, and local officials and patriotic, civic, and educational organizations to plan and hold, on or about May 19, exercise designated to help our new citizens, both native-born and naturalized, to understand more fully the significance and responsibilities of citizenship in our self-governing Republic, so that they may be better prepared to add strength to the common purpose of all our citizens that this Republic shall continue to maintain its place of leadership and service among the nations of the world.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 12th day of March in the year of our Lord, nineteen hundred and forty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America, the one hundred and seventieth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

JAMES F. BYRNES,
Secretary of State.
