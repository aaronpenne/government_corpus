PART I-Purposes 
The purposes of this proclamation are: 
(a)                      To proclaim an agreement for the accession of Spain to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). (61 tat. (pt. 5) A11) 
(b)                 To terminate in part a proclamation relating to a prior trade agreement with Spain. 
PART II IDENTIFICATION AND JUSTIFICATION 
(A) Agreement supplementary to GATT 
(1)                 Identification of Agreement. The protocol of July 1, 1963 for the accession of Spain to GATT, containing no new tariff concessions by the United States, supplements provisions of GATT which have been proclaimed. This protocol includes a schedule to GATT of United States concessions (hereinafter referred to as "schedule XX" Spain-1963) which comprises the concessions provided for in the schedule of United States concessions annexed to the Interim Agreement of December 31, 1962, signed by the United States and Spain, and proclaimed by Part III (A) of Proclamation 3517 of January 31, 1963 (28 P.R. 1195). Schedule XX (Spain-1963) became a schedule to GATT on August 29, 1963. A copy of the protocol of July 1, 1963, is annexed to this proclamation. 
(2)       Determination that It Is Required or Appropriate that GATT be Supplemented. As President, I have determined that it is required or appropriate, on and after August 29, 1963, that those provisions of GATT and of agreements supplementary thereto which have heretofore been proclaimed be applied as supplemented by the protocol of July 1, 1963 (identified in paragraph (1) of this subpart). 
"That agreement of October 30, 1947, has been proclaimed by Proclamation 2761A of December 16, 1947 (61 Stat. (pt. 2) 1103) which proclamation has been supplemented by subsequent proclamations. 
S The agreement annexed to this proclamation has been published by the Contracting Parties to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the United States sales agency for the publications of which is the Columbia University Press. The English text of the general provisions of this agreement and the schedule of United States concessions will be published in Treasury Decisions (Customs) with this proclamation. The agreement will be published by the Department of State in Treaties and Other International Act Series (TIAS) and eventually in United States Treaties (UST). 
(B) Termination of prior trade agreement proclamations 
As President, I determine that on and after August 29, 1963 it is required or appropriate that Part III (A) of Proclamation 3517 of January 31, 1963 (28 F.R. 1195) be terminated in part insofar as it relates to the Interim Agreement of December 31, 1962 (identified in subpart (A) (1) of this part). This termination results from the proclamation in Part III (A) of this proclamation of schedule XX (Spain-1963) comprising the same concessions as were proclaimed by the proclamation of January 31, 1963. 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 under the authority vested in me as President, by the Constitution and statutes, including section 350 (A) (6) of the Tariff Act of 1930, as amended (19 U.S.C. 1351(a) (6)), do proclaim that: 
PART III-PROCLAIMING PART 
(A)        Agreement supplementary to a trade agreement 
On and after August 29, 1963, those provisions of GATT and agreements supplementary thereto which have heretofore been proclaimed shall be applied as supplemented by the protocol relating to Spain of July 1, 1963 (identified in Part II(A) (1) of this proclamation), 
(B)        Termination of prior trade agreement proclamation 
On and after August 29, 1963, the proclamation of January 31, 1963 (identified in Part II B) of this proclamation) is terminated in part as specified in Part 11 (B) of this proclamation. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this sixth day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-eighth.
