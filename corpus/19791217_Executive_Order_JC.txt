RELATING TO THE PRESIDENT'S COMMISSION FOR THE STUDY OF ETHICAL PROBLEMS IN MEDICINE AND BIOMEDICAL AND BEHAVIORAL RESEARCH 
Public Law 95-622 established the President's Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. Appropriations to fund the work of the Commission, although authorized, have not been sought or received, but entities within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare have authority and funds which may be available to carry on activities identical to those to be undertaken by the Commission. Therefore, in order to permit these entities to support the conduct of those activities by the Commission, and under the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution of the United States, it is ordered: 
1-101. There is established the President's Special Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research. The Special Commission established by this Order shall be constituted in accordance with and subject to the provisions of Title III of Public Law 95-622, except that it shall receive financial support, to the extent permitted by law and subject to the availability of funds, from the Department of Health, Education and Welfare. The Administrator of General Services shall provide administrative support services to the Special Commission on a reimbursable basis. 
1-102. The Special Commission established by this Order shall terminate upon enactment and availability of appropriations for the Commission established by Public Law 95-622, and in any event, unless extended, no later than two years from the date of this Order. No funds transferred by the Department of Health, Education and Welfare pursuant to this Order shall be expended by either Commission following termination of the Special Commission.
