By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. Pursuant to Section 201(d)(1) of the Trade Act of 1974 (the Trade Act) (19 U.S.C. 2251(d)(1)), the United States International Trade Commission (USITC) on March 25, 1986, reported to the President the results of its investigation No. TA-20156 under Section 201(b) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2251(b)). The USITC determined that wood shingles and shakes, provided for in item 200.85 of the Tariff Schedules of the United States (TSUS), are being imported into the United States in such increased quantities as to be a substantial cause of serious injury to the domestic industry producing articles like or directly competitive with the imported articles. The USITC recommend that a tariff of 35 percent ad valorem be imposed for a period of 5 years on imports of wood shingles and shakes of western red cedar in order to remedy this serious injury. 
2. On May 23, 1986, pursuant to Section 202(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(b)(1)), and after taking into account the considerations specified in Section 202(c) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2252(c)), in order to remedy this serious injury, I determined to impose a tariff on imports into the United States of wood shingles and shakes of western red cedar in an amount that differs from the tariff recommended by the USITC. On May 23, 1986, in accordance with Section 203(b)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(b)(1)), I transmitted a report to the Congress setting forth my determination and intention to proclaim a temporary tariff and stating the reason why my decision differed from the action recommended by the USITC. 
3. Section 203(e)(1) of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253(e)(1)) requires that import relief be proclaimed and take effect within 15 days after the import relief determination date. 
4. Pursuant to Sections 203(a)(1) and 203(e)(1) of the Trade Act, I am providing import relief through the temporary imposition of a tariff on wood shingles and shakes of western red cedar, as hereinafter proclaimed. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, acting under the authority vested in me by the Constitution and the statutes of the United States, including Sections 203 and 604 of the Trade Act (19 U.S.C. 2253 and 2483), do proclaim thatâ€” 
(l) Subpart A, part 2 of the Appendix to the TSUS is modified as set forth in the Annex to this proclamation. 
(2) This proclamation shall be effective with respect to articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption, on or after June 7, 1986, and before the close of June 6, 1991, unless the period of its effectiveness is earlier expressly modified or terminated. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 6th day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
