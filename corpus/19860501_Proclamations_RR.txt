By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The freedom of thought and action we Americans enjoy today seems as natural as the air we breathe. But there is a danger we may take this freedom for granted. We must never forget it was bought for us at a great price. The brave and resourceful Americans whose sacrifices gained our Independence and preserved it for more than 200 years against formidable foes have set an example of unflinching loyalty to the ideal of liberty and justice for all. 
Our great Nation is at peace, but peace demands of us a commitment to defend the system of government that has so effectively ensured our freedoms. To encourage our vigilance and so that we may rededicate ourselves to sustaining the great American ideals, the Congress, by joint resolution approved July 18, 1958 (72 Stat. 369, 36 U.S.C. 162), has designated May i of each year as "Loyalty Day." 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1, 1986, as Loyalty Day and call upon all Americans and all patriotic, civic, fraternal, and educational organizations to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies. I also call upon government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings and grounds on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this first day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
