A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 December 15, 1958, marks the one hundred and sixty-seventh anniversary of the adoption of our Bill of Rights, which is held in grateful pride and honor by American citizens; and
Whereas
 December 10, 1958, marks the tenth anniversary of the proclamation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and this day will be observed by the members of the United Nations as Human Rights Day; and
Whereas
 fundamental rights and freedoms—freedom of speech and of the press, freedom of assembly and association, freedom of conscience and religious worship, the right to fair trial and equal treatment under law—are being sought by peoples everywhere; and
Whereas
 we must press forward to achieve these fundamental rights and freedoms for all persons equally:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the period of December 10 to December 17, 1958, as Human Rights Week; and I call upon the citizens of the United States to observe this week by rereading and studying the Bill of Rights in the Constitution of the United States and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights of the United Nations, that we may all be reminded of our many responsibilities and privileges as a people blessed by a heritage of freedom and equality. Let us firmly rededicate ourselves to the achievement of the goals of liberty and equal opportunity for posterity, for ourselves and for our neighbors throughout the world.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twentieth day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-eight and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-third.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
