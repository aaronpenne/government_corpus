By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Our beautiful land is blessed from sea to shining sea with bountiful natural and cultural resources on Federal, State, and local lands. We are also blessed that the American people possess a unique volunteer spirit rooted in our frontier tradition. 
It is truly fitting that we take a special period of time to recognize our Nation's recreational and cultural resources and how they contribute to the economic and social well-being of our communities and our country. Through our stewardship of these natural wonders and great monuments to history, we can express our love for our country, our pride in America, and our desire to preserve our resources and our heritage for the future. 
The Take Pride in America campaign, with its theme, "Take Pride in America: You Can Make a Difference," encourages all of us to do just this. The campaign is a partnership of public and private groups, Federal agencies, and State and local governments that fosters public awareness of the need for wise stewardship of our natural resources and for retention of our countless cultural resources as well. Lot us remind ourselves often, this month and always, to do our share and "Take Pride in America." 
The Congress, by House Joint Resolution 530, has designated May 1988 as "Take Pride in America Month" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim May 1988 as Take Pride in America Month. I call upon the people of the United States and government officials at every level to observe this month with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and twelfth.
RONALD REAGAN
