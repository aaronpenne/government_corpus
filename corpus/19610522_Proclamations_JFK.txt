A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the United Nations has clearly demonstrated its capacity to act as a force for peace and human advancement, and has provided a dynamic spirit which is leading the nations of the world along the road to human progress; and 
Whereas
 the United Nations is available to assist all nations and peoples in their efforts to combat hunger, disease, and despair; and 
Whereas
 the United States strongly supports the United Nations, the Charter of which is rooted in ideals and aspirations which we share with freedom-loving people in all parts of the world; and 
Whereas
 the United States considers that this world organization is an indispensable instrument of international peace, economic improvement, and social development, and that any attempt to destroy it would be a blow aimed directly at the independence and security of nations, large and small; and 
Whereas
 the General Assembly of the United Nations has resolved that October twenty-fourth, the anniversary of the coming into force of the United Nations Charter, should be dedicated each year to making known the purposes, principles, and accomplishments of the United Nations: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the citizens of this Nation to observe Tuesday, October 24, 1961, as United Nations Day by means of community programs which will demonstrate their faith in the United Nations and contribute to a better understanding of its aims, problems, and accomplishments. 
I also call upon the officials of the Federal and State Governments and upon local officials to encourage citizen groups and agencies of the press, radio, television, and motion pictures to engage in appropriate observance of United Nations Day throughout the land in cooperation with the United States Committee for the United Nations and other organizations. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-second day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
