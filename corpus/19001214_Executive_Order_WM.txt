By virtue of the authority vested in me as Commander-in-Chief of the Army and Navy of the United States of America, I hereby empower the Naval officer in command at the Island of Guam to act as Collector of Customs for said Island, with authority to appoint a deputy if necessary.
I further direct that any authority heretofore exercised under the direction of the commandant at said Naval Station in respect to the collection of customs be approved as if direct mention of such authority had been included in the Executive Order of February 1, 1900.
In case the commandant shall make such appointment from civil life he shall require of the appointee good and sufficient security for the due performance of the duties of the office.
Any authority heretofore exercised in the premises by the Naval Officer in command is hereby ratified as if said power to appoint had been conferred in said Executive Order of February 1, 1900.
WILLIAM MCKINLEY
