By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Flood waters raging throughout eleven States have driven 200,000 people from their homes, with every indication that this number may be materially increased within the next twenty-four hours. In this grave emergency the homeless are turning to our great national relief agency, the American Red Cross, for food, clothing, shelter and medical care.
To enable the Red Cross to meet this immediate obligation and to continue to carry the burden of caring for these unfortunate men, women and children until their homes are restored and they can return to normal living conditions, it is necessary that a minimum relief fund of three million dollars be raised as promptly as possible.
As President of the United States and as President of the American Red Cross, I am, therefore, urging our people to contribute promptly and most generously so that sufficient funds may be available for the relief of these thousands of our homeless fellow citizens. I am confident that in the face of this great need your response will be as immediate and as generous as has always been the case when the Red Cross has acted as your agent in the relief of human suffering.
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT
