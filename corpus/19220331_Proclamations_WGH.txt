A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 the protection and perpetuation of our forests are vital to our continued industrial welfare and national strength, and to our individual health, comfort, and prosperity, and Whereas, a period of fifty years has passed since, in April, 1872, there was instituted in the State of Nebraska observance of a day especially set apart and consecrated for tree planting, and known as Arbor Day, and
Whereas,
 both through widespread annual celebration of Arbor Day and through the increasing observance of Forest Protection Week public attention has been commendably directed to the value of trees, the unnecessary waste of our diminishing forests through preventable fires, the deplorable effects of forest devastation, and the need for remedial measures against depletion of an essential natural resource:
Therefore, I, Warren G. Harding,
 President of the United States, do urge upon the Governors of the various States to designate and set apart the week of April 16-22, 1922, as Forest Protection Week, and the last day of that week, April 22, as the Golden Anniversary of Arbor Day, and to request officers of public instruction, of counties, cities and towns, and of civic and commercial organizations to unite in thought and action for the preservation of our common heritage by planning such educational and instructive exercises as shall bring before the people the disastrous effects of the present waste by forest fires, and the need of individual and collective effort to conserve the forests and increase our tree growth for ornament and use.
In witness whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 31st day of March in the year of our Lord one thousand nine hundred and twenty-two, and of the independence of the United States of America the one hundred and forty-sixth.
WARREN G. HARDING
