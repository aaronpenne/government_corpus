By virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is hereby ordered as follows:
1. Subject to valid existing rights, all public lands of the United States, including Alaska, which contain deposits of radio-active mineral substances, and all deposits of such substances, are hereby withdrawn from sale and all other forms of disposal under the public-land laws, including the mining laws, and reserved for the use of the United States.
2. So far as not in conflict with existing law, all lands in the United States, its territories or possessions, heretofore acquired by the United States which contain deposits of radio-active mineral substances owned by the United States are hereby reserved from sale, and all leases, licenses, or other authorizations of whatever kind hereafter granted to occupy or use such lands, shall reserve to the United States the right, at any and all times, to enter upon such lands, and mine and remove such mineral substances; and all such lands hereafter acquired by the United States shall become subject to the provisions of this paragraph upon their acquisition; Provided, That no reservation under this paragraph shall interfere with the use of the lands established or indicated by any act of Congress.
