A Proclamation
 
Walter Q. Gresham, Secretary of State of the United States, is dead. The President in making this distressing announcement to his fellow-countrymen speaks from the depths of a personal affliction to remind them that they too have lost a pure and able public servant, a wise and patriotic guardian of all their rights and interests, a manly and loyal American, and a generous and lovable man.
As a suitable expression of national bereavement, I direct that the diplomatic representatives of the United States in all foreign countries display the flags over their embassies and legations at half-mast for ten days; that for a like period the flag of the United States be displayed at half-mast at all forts and military posts and at all naval stations and on all vessels of the United States.
I further order that on the day of the funeral the Executive Departments in the city of Washington be closed and that on all public buildings throughout the United States the national flag be displayed at half-mast.
Done at the city of Washington, this 28th day of May, A. D. 1895, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and nineteenth.
GROVER CLEVELAND.
By the president:
EDWIN F. UHL,
 Acting Secretary of State.
