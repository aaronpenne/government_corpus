Executive Order No. 11399 of March 6, 1968, as amended by Executive Order No. 11551 of August 11, 1970, provides that the National Council on Indian Opportunity shall consist of the Vice President of the United States, who serves as the Chairman of the Council, the Attorney General, the Secretary of the Interior, the Secretary of Agriculture, the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, the Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, and eight Indian leaders appointed by the President of the United States for terms of two years. Experience has demonstrated that it would be advisable to stagger the terms of the Indian-leader members of the Council so that the terms of only four of those members will expire in any year. That change would provide continuity in the Indian-leader membership of the Council.
Now, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, section 1 of Executive Order No. 11399 of March 6, 1968, as amended, is hereby further amended by adding, at its end, the following:
"In order to provide staggered terms for Indian-leader members of the Council appointed after August 31, 1972, the President shall, notwithstanding the terms prescribed by the last phrase of the preceding sentence, appoint four Indian-leaders to serve as members of the Council for terms ending August 31, 1973, and four for terms ending August 31, 1974. Each of their successors shall be appointed for a term of two years from the date of the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed. Any Indian-leader member appointed to fill a vacancy occurring prior to the expiration of the term for which his predecessor was appointed shall be appointed only for the remainder of such term."
