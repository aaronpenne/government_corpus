A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 preventable, destructive fires continue to be a major cause of human suffering and economic waste in communities throughout the Nation; and
Whereas
 intelligent and determined individual and cooperative action can reduce in great measure this needless waste of our country's resources:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 9, 1960, as Fire Prevention Week.
I call upon our people to promote programs for the prevention and control of fires; and I urge State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as schools, civic groups, and public-information agencies, to share actively in observing Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this national effort to reduce the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-ninth day of July in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
CHRISTIAN A. HERTER,
