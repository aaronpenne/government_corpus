A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights was adopted by the General Assembly of the United Nations on December 10, 1948, as a common standard of achievement, and the anniversary of its adoption is now celebrated throughout the world as a time to increase understanding of this great document; and
Whereas
 the Universal Declaration of Human Rights proclaims that recognition of the inherent dignity and the equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family is the foundation of freedom, justice, and peace in the world, and declares that the basis of the authority of government shall be the will of the people; and
Whereas
 these essential principles of liberty and free government are affirmed likewise in our Declaration of Independence, the Constitution of the United States, and the Constitutions and basic laws of our States and territories:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe December 10, 1953, as United Nations Human Rights Day. The guarding of our heritage of individual liberty is the sacred obligation of every citizen of our Republic. Let us study the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Bills of Rights in our own Constitutions and basic laws, that they may arouse our consciences to the need to defend our liberties and to extend the frontiers of freedom, thus hastening the day when all people, of whatever nation, race, or creed, will be secure in the enjoyment of their human rights and fundamental freedoms.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 30th day of November in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
By the President:
JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
Secretary of State
