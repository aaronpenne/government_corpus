 Members shall serve without compensation for their work on the PCAST. However, members may be allowed travel expenses, including per diem in lieu of subsistence, as authorized by law for persons serving intermittently in the government service (5 U.S.C. 5701â€“5707).
 (d)
 Any expenses of the PCAST shall be paid from the funds available for the expenses of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.

 The PCAST shall terminate 2 years from the date of this order unless extended by the President prior to that date.
