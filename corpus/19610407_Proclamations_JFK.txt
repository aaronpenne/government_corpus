A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 no nation can remain free unless its people cherish their freedoms, understand the responsibilities they entail, and nurture the will to preserve them; and 
Whereas
 law is the strongest link between man and freedom, and by strengthening the rule of law we strengthen freedom and justice in our own country and contribute by example to the goal of justice under law for all mankind; and 
Whereas
 the Congress of the United States, by a joint resolution approved April 7, 1961, has designated the first day of May of each year as Law Day, U.S.A., and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for appropriate observance of that day; and 
Whereas
 the objectives of Law Day, U.S.A., are to urge Americans to rededicate themselves to the ideals of equality and justice under law in their relations with each other and with other nations; to cultivate that respect for law which is vital in a democratic society; and to foster a full understanding and appreciation of our liberties and of the legal and judicial institutions which protect them: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby urge the people of the United States to observe Monday, May 1, 1961, as Law Day, U.S.A., with suitable ceremonies. I especially urge that public bodies, educational institutions, the legal profession, civic and service organizations, and the media of information take the lead in sponsoring and participating in educational undertakings and other appropriate means to give effect to the objectives of this national observance. 
I also call upon public officials to cause the flag of the United States to be displayed on all government buildings on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY

DEAN RUSK,
