By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
For more than 50 years, our Nation has benefitted from the service of women in every branch of our Armed Forces. Women have served with distinction in every overseas combat theater of every conflict since World War I. Some have been wounded in the line of duty, and others have given their lives for our country, but all have been a vital element in the success of America's Armed Forces. Bringing their talent, skill, and vision to a variety of occupations, they have made a lasting mark upon the military history of the United States. 
The contributions and the sacrifices of the women who have served in our Armed Forces merit the respect and admiration of the people of the United States. Thus, it is most fitting that we set aside a special time to honor our women veterans. 
In grateful recognition of the women who have served in the Armed Forces of the United States, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 35, has designated the week beginning November 5, 1989, as "National Women Veterans Recognition Week" and has authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, George Bush,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning November 5, 1989, as National Women Veterans Recognition Week. I call upon the people of the United States to observe the week with appropriate programs, ceremonies, and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this ninth day of November, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourteenth. 
GEORGE BUSH
