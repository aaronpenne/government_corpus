WHEREAS the United States has initiated a program for the development of commercial supersonic aircraft; and
WHEREAS supersonic transport will advance technical knowledge, expand our international trade, strengthen our manufacturing capability, and provide employment for thousands of our citizens; and
WHEREAS the development of supersonic transport will require the participation and assistance of various Federal agencies as well as private manufacturing and transportation interests; and
WHEREAS the development of supersonic transport will involve heavy expenditures of money and resources and it is therefore essential that the activities of the Federal agencies concerned be coordinated at the highest level:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me as President of the United States, it is ordered as follows:

Sec. 4. Members of the Committee who are officers or employees of the Federal Government shall receive no additional compensation by reason of such membership.
