A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 destructive fires continue to take an enormous toll of life and property despite the compelling need for the conservation of our human and natural resources in order to strengthen the defense of the Nation; and
Whereas
 a more concerted and widespread effort to prevent such fires must be made during the coming year if the lives of approximately eleven thousand of our citizens are to be spared, and the suffering and disability of many thousands more prevented; and
Whereas
, in this period of crisis, the Nation can ill afford the needless waste of nearly a billion dollars in irreplaceable materials, facilities, and resources:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning October 5, 1952, as Fire Prevention Week.
I urge that every man, woman, and child in this great country contribute to the nation-wide effort to strengthen the United States by accepting a personal responsibility in the never-ending campaign to save life and property by preventing destructive fires. I request that State and local governments, the American National Red Cross, the National Fire Waste Council, the Chamber of Commerce of the United States, and business, labor, and farm organizations, as well as churches, schools, civic groups, and agencies of public information, cooperate fully in the observance of Fire Prevention Week. I also direct the appropriate agencies of the Federal Government to assist in this crusade against the loss of life and property resulting from fires.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 18th day of August in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-two, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DAVID BRUCE,
Acting Secretary of State.
