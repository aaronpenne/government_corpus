A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it has become our hallowed custom to observe June 14 of each year as Flag Day by engaging in patriotic exercises and by displaying the American flag proudly in commemoration of its adoption on June 14 in the year 1777; and
Whereas
 this symbol of our national strength, our national unity, and our national integrity now flies with the flags of all the other United Nations as an earnest of newly achieved international strength, unity, and integrity; and
Whereas
, in the words of President Wilson set forth in his Flag Day proclamation of 1916, the anniversary of the adoption of the Stars and Stripes as our national emblem "should this year and in the years to come be given special significance as a day of renewal and reminder, a day upon which we should direct our minds . . . to thoughts of the ideals and principles of which we have sought to make our great Government the embodiment":
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate June 14, 1947, as Flag Day; and I direct the officials of the Federal Government and request the officials of the State and local governments to have our colors displayed on all public buildings on that day.
I also urge the people of the United States to fly the American flag from their homes on June 14, and I suggest that civic groups and individuals arrange, where feasible, for joint displays of the emblems of the United Nations in recognition of our joint dedication to the freedom of mankind.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 27th day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-first. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN

G. C. MARSHALL,
