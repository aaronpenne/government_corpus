By the authority vested in me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, including section 1 of the International Organizations Immunities Act (22 U.S.C. 288), and in light of the Act of Congress authorizing the participation of the United States in the International Development Law Institute, section 805 of the Freedom Support Act of 1992, Public Law 102â€“511, I hereby designate the International Development Law Institute as a public international organization entitled to enjoy the privileges, exemptions, and immunities conferred by the International Organizations Immunities Act. This designation is not intended to abridge in any respect the privileges, exemptions, or immunities that such organization may have acquired or may acquire by international agreements or by congressional action.
