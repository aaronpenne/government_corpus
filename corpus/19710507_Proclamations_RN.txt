By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Throughout this Nation's history, American mothers have played a very special role—helping to pioneer the land, enriching our community life, and bringing deeper meaning to the lives of their husbands and children.
In recent years we have come to appreciate more than ever before the influential contribution mothers can make in the extended community beyond the home. But even as new horizons are opened for many mothers, each mother's responsibility to her children still defines her central role.
In our society, we want to see each person fulfill his unique potential. It is fitting therefore that we recognize and honor the part that mothers play in the development of their children—even as we welcome new opportunities for mothers to contribute to the Nation's life.
The Congress, by a joint resolution of May 8, 1914, has set aside the second Sunday of May of each year as a day on which we honor all mothers for their countless contributions to their own families, to their communities, and to the Nation.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby request that Sunday, May 9, 1971, be observed throughout the land as Mother's Day. I direct Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings, and I urge all citizens to display the flag at their homes and other suitable places on that day as a public expression of love and respect for the mothers of our country.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this 7th day of May, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
