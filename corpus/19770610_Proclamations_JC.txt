By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The Nation's first black newspaper was founded in 1827. In the 150 years since, the black press has come to serve more than 25,000,000 Americans, and has been a major factor in their advancement. 
The black press has had to overcome great obstacles to achieve the respect it commands today as a voice for individual freedom, dignity, and equality. 
That it has done so, while remaining faithful to the standards of professional journalism, is a tribute to the dedication, responsibility and zeal of its members. 
As we go forward with our efforts to make equality of opportunity a reality for all Americans, we will continue to depend on the black press to provide us with guidance, insight and wisdom. 
I urge every American to support the continuing efforts of the black press to help assure that America achieves its full potential. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Friday, June 17, 1977, as Black Press Day. I urge all Americans to reflect upon the contributions of the black press to the realization of the principles upon which our Nation was founded. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this tenth day of June in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy-seven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and first.
JIMMY CARTER
