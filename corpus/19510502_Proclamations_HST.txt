A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 preventable accidents continue to kill thousands and injure hundreds of thousands of farm residents each year; and
Whereas
 such accidents deprive the Nation of needed manpower and destroy property vital to our defense; and
Whereas
 a careless or imprudent act is a factor in almost every accident on the farm; and
Whereas
 experience has established the fact that observance of safe practices in working and living can greatly reduce these losses:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the nation to observe the week commencing July 22, 1951, as National Farm Safety Week, and I urgently request each member of every farm family to adopt safe practices in every activity; to drive safely, work safely, and live safely. I also request all organizations and persons interested in farm life to join in a continuing program to encourage the idea that farming the safe way is farming the right way.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 2d day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
DEAN ACHESON,
Secretary of State.
