A Proclamation
 
Whereas,
 in various periods of history, freedom-loving men have willingly left their homelands to fight on foreign soil for the cause of liberty, as even now United Nations troops are battling in the Far East on behalf of that cause; and
Whereas
 an exemplar of this devotion to principle, Count Casimir Pulaski, came to America in 1777 to serve with our Revolutionary Army, and two years later suffered a mortal wound while leading the brave Legion which he had formed and which bore his name; and
Whereas
 we who are determined to hold fast to our heritage of independence may be spiritually strengthened by renewing our appreciation of the high motives and selfless service of this noble Pole:
Now, Therefore, I, Harry S. Truman,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby set aside Wednesday, October 11, 1950, the one hundred and seventy-first anniversary of his death, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day; I direct that the American flag be flown on all Government buildings on that date; and I urge the people of the United States to observe the day with ceremonies designed to commemorate the sacrifice made by General Pulaski for freedom's sake.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
Done
 at the City of Washington this 25th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-fifth. 
HARRY S. TRUMAN
By the President:
JAMES E. WEBB,
Acting Secretary of State.
