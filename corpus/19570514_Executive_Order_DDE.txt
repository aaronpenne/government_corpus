WHEREAS there exists a labor dispute between the Goodyear Atomic Corporation and certain of its employees represented by Local 10-689, Oil, Chemical, and Atomic Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, at certain facilities (known as the Portsmouth Plant) of the Atomic Energy Commission located near Waverly, Ohio; and
WHEREAS such dispute has resulted in a strike which, in my opinion, affects a substantial part of an industry engaged in trade or commerce among the several States or with foreign nations, or in the production of goods for commerce, which strike, if permitted to continue, will imperil the national safety:
NOW, THEREFORE, by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 206 of the Labor-Management Relations Act, 1947, 61 Stat. 155, I hereby create a Board of Inquiry, consisting of such members as I shall appoint, to inquire into the issues involved in such dispute.
The Board shall have powers and duties as set forth in Title II of the said Act. The Board shall report to the President in accordance with the provisions of section 206 of the said Act on or before May 15, 1957.
Upon submission of its report, the Board shall continue in existence to perform such other functions as may be required under the said Act, until the Board is terminated by the President.
