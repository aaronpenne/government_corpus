By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
On the eleventh day of October, the people of the United States will honor the 200th anniversary of the death of the Polish patriot, Casimir Pulaski. On the bicentennial of his death, caused by wounds suffered during the Battle of Savannah, we are reminded of his heroism and his selflessness as he led his famous cavalry unit, The Pulaski Legion, in the struggle for American independence. 
As we pay tribute to General Pulaski and his sacrifices for freedom, both here and in his native land, we also honor the contributions made by generations of Americans of Polish descent to the greatness of our Nation. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Thursday, October 11, 1979, as General Pulaski's Memorial Day, and I direct the appropriate government officials to display the flag of the United States on all government buildings on that day. 
I also invite the people of the United States to honor the memory of General Pulaski by holding appropriate exercises and ceremonies in suitable places throughout our land. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this sixteenth day of August, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth.
JIMMY CARTER
