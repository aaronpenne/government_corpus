By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
Project Concern is an international, nonprofit, medical-dental assistance organization, supported entirely by private contributions. Since its founding in 1961, it has grown from a small clinic in one country to two hospitals, eight clinics, feeding stations, and self-help medical training programs in Hong Kong, South Vietnam, Mexico, and the United States. It has helped more than half-a-million people to solve their medical needs. This year, more than 200,000 ill and hungry children and parents will be helped.
In recognition of this humanitarian effort, the Congress by House Joint Resolution 1178 has requested the President to issue a proclamation designating the month of October 1970 as Project Concern Month.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the month of October 1970 as Project Concern Month; and I urge the people of the United States to aid this worthwhile project in every way.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-sixth day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-fifth.
RICHARD NIXON
