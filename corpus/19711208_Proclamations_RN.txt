By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
"The character inherent in the American people," Thoreau observed long ago, "has done all that has been accomplished" by the United States in the cause of mankind. Today, character remains our greatest national resource. Developing character in individuals, and mobilizing it through community action, remains our most vital work.
Over the past half-century, no organization has contributed more splendidly to this work than the United States Jaycees. Through Jaycee programs, young men by the hundreds of thousands have broadened their lives toward fuller achievement and stretched out their hands toward fellowmen in need. The two letters "JC" say a great deal. They spell "benefactor" for unfortunate people, from mentally retarded children to Peruvian earthquake victims. They spell "partner" for government officials, law enforcement agencies, educators, and social workers in the more than 6,000 communities that have Jaycee chapters. They spell "growth" for the nearly 325,000 men who today live by the Jaycees' Creedâ€”faith, brotherhood, freedom, the rule of law, the potential of man, the life of service.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning January 16, 1972, as National Jaycee Week. I encourage all Americans to accord due honor and recognition to the ideals and achievements of the U.S. Jaycees, and to the service-minded men who carry on this good work.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this eighth day of December, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
