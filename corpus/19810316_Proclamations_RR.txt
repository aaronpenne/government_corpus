By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
American farmers and ranchers are at the core of our Nation's economy, providing food not only for our own people, but for millions of others around the world. 
Yet we must not take the miracle of American agricultural abundance for granted. An unacceptable number of farm accidents cripples people and threatens production. Last year, nearly 400,000 farmers and ranchers were injured or killed in accidents at work, at home, during recreation, or on roads. 
Powerful equipment, chemicals and variable working conditions are potential agricultural hazards, but safe work practices, protective equipment and other measures can minimize the risks. Special vigilance by the agricultural community is also necessary to reduce the toll of off-the-job injuries. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week of July 25 through July 31, 1981, as National Farm Safety Week. I urge all persons engaged in farming and ranching and all persons and organizations allied with agriculture to redouble their personal and group efforts for farm, home, recreation and highway safety. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 16th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyone, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
RONALD REAGAN
