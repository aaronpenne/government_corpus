By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The Director of the Office of Emergency Preparedness has found, with the advice of the Oil Policy Committee, that to increase the maximum level of imports of crude oil, unfinished oils and finished products into Districts I-IV by one hundred thousand barrels per day beginning March 1, 1970, will not adversely affect the national security.
The Director has also found, with the advice of the Oil Policy Committee, that the importation from Western Hemisphere sources into District I of a limited additional quantity of No. 2 fuel oil during the period July 1, 1970, through December 31, 1970, for distribution through independent deep water terminals, will increase available supply of the product in District I without adversely affecting the national security.
I accept the findings of the Director and deem it necessary and consistent with the security objectives of Proclamation 3279 to adjust imports as hereinafter provided.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon,
 President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the Constitution and statutes, including Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, do hereby proclaim that:
(1) Subparagraph (1) of paragraph (a) of Section 2 of Proclamation 3279 of March 10, 1959, as amended, is hereby amended as follows: After the first sentence insert a new sentence reading: "Such maximum level of imports is increased (i) effective March 1, 1970, by one hundred thousand barrels per day for the balance of the current allocation period and by one hundred thousand barrels per day for each succeeding allocation period; and (ii), for the period July 1, 1970, through December 31, 1970, notwithstanding any other provision of this Proclamation, by forty thousand barrels per day into District I of No. 2 fuel oil, manufactured in the Western Hemisphere from crude oil produced in the Western Hemisphere, for allocation, under regulations of the Secretary, to persons in the business in District I of selling No. 2 fuel oil who do not have crude oil import allocations into Districts I-IV and who operate deep water terminals in District I or have through-put agreements with deep water terminal operators in District I who do not have crude oil import allocations into Districts I-IV, on a fair and equitable basis, to the extent possible, in relation to such persons' inputs of No. 2 fuel oil to such terminals, having regard to any product import allocations into Districts I-IV made to such persons."
(2) Section 1 of Proclamation 3279 of March 10, 1959, as amended, is hereby amended as follows:
(a) Strike the period at the end of paragraph (a) and add: "or (5) as provided in paragraph (d) of this section."
(b) Add a new paragraph (d), reading:
"(d) The Secretary may by regulation provide that no license or allocation shall be required in connection with the transportation to the United States by pipeline through a foreign country of crude oil, unfinished oils, or finished products produced in the customs territory of the United States or, in the event of commingling with foreign oils of like kind and qualities incidental to such transportation, of quantities equivalent to the quantities produced in and shipped from such customs territory."
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this seventeenth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-fourth.
RICHARD NIXON
