Whereas under the provisions of article VII of the Convention between the United States and the Republic of Panama signed at Washington on November 18, 1903, as modified by article VI of the Treaty between the United States and the Republic of Panama signed at Washington on March 2, 1936, there are now in force and operation two certain contracts of September 30, 1910 (Contracts PCI p-360 and PCI p-361), between the Government of the Republic of Panama and the Isthmian Canal Commission, and the subsequent agreements, covering the operation and maintenance by the United States of the water and sewerage installed by the United States in the cities if Panama and Colon, the maintenance and repair by the United States of the pavements constructed by the United States in the cities of Panama and Colon and other related maters;

Whereas it is necessary that the maintenance and operation of the said water and sewerage systems and the performance of other functions which the United States has been performing under the contracts and agreements hereinbefore mentioned continue without interruption; and
