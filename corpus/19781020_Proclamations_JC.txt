A Proclamation
 
Families differ, but the values of family life are unchanging?warmth, love, compassion, support, and understanding. Families are the building blocks of civilization. Our social and individual achievements, be they great or small, can generally be traced to early family influences. Family values are our most fundamental and lasting heritage. 
Changing social patterns have threatened family stability. In today's increasingly complex world it is important to maintain the values and continuity of family life. All families are important, but the extended family, the foster family and the adoptive family play a special role by relieving the isolation of those who lack the comfort of a loving nuclear family. 
Thus, National Family Week offers the opportunity to pay special tribute to those who open their homes and provide the warmth of family life to those who would otherwise be alone. We salute all families as we focus attention this week on opportunities to restore their strength and help them meet the challenges of contemporary society. 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, in accordance with a joint resolution of Congress, do hereby proclaim the week of November 19, 1978, as National Family Week and call upon the American people to observe this week with appropriate thoughts and actions in their houses and communities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of October, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and third.
JIMMY CARTER
