A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 our rural and urban people have a community of interests that makes them mutually and beneficially dependent upon each other; and
Whereas
 the productivity of our farms and industry provides the food, fiber, tools, and services that have given our Nation the highest standard of living ever enjoyed by any people; and
Whereas
 the future well-being of our Nation requires a better public understanding of the needs, problems, and opportunities of our country's agriculture and the necessity for well-trained capable young men and women:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the period from November 20 through November 26, 1959, as National Farm-City Week, and I call upon the people throughout the country to participate fully in the observance of that week.
I request the Department of Agriculture, the land-grant colleges, the Agricultural Extension Service, and all other appropriate agencies and officials of the Government to cooperate with National, State, and local farm organizations and other groups in preparing and carrying out programs for the appropriate observance of National Farm-City Week, including public meetings, discussions, exhibits, pageants, and press, radio, and television features, with special emphasis on the notable achievements of rural groups and individuals working to promote the cultural, spiritual, educational, recreational, and health facilities of their areas.
I also request urban groups to join in this observance, along with farm groups, as evidence of America's appreciation of all those on the farms and in the cities who provide us with our daily bread and all the other necessities of life.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this twenty-ninth day of October in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-nine, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fourth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER
