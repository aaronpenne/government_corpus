By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 it appears that certain lands which are now a part of the Wupatki National Monument in the State of Arizona, established by Proclamation of December 9, 1924, 43 Stat. 1977, and enlarged by Proclamation of July 9, 1937, 50 Stat. 1841, are not necessary for the proper care and management of the objects of historic and scientific interest situated on the lands within the said monument; and 
Whereas
 it appears that it would be in the public interest to exclude such lands from the Wupatki National Monument; and 
Whereas
 such lands are needed in the construction and operation of a diversion dam in Little Colorado River to facilitate the irrigation of lands on the Navajo Indian Reservation: 
Now, Therefore, I, Franklin D. Roosevelt,
 President of the United States of America, under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by section 2 of the act of June 8, 1906, c. 3060, 34 Stat. 225 (U.S.C., title 16, sec. 431), and by the act of June 25, 1910, c. 421, 36 Stat. 847 (U.S.C., title 43, sec. 141), as amended by the act of August 24, 1912, c. 369, 37 Stat. 497 (U.S.C., title 43, sec. 142), do proclaim that the lands comprising Lots 1 and 2, Section 12, Township 25 North, Range 10 East, Gila and Salt River Meridian, Arizona, comprising 52.27 acres, are hereby excluded from the Wupatki National Monument, and temporarily withdrawn from settlement, location, sale, or entry and reserved for use in connection with the construction and operation of a diversion dam in Little Colorado River for irrigating Navajo Indian lands. The provisions of the Proclamations of December 9, 1924, and July 9, 1937, shall remain in full force and effect as to all other lands thereby reserved as a national monument. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this 22nd day of January in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and forty-one, and of the Independence of the United States the one hundred and sixty-fifth. 
FRANKLIN D. ROOSEVELT

CORDELL HULL 
The Secretary of State.
