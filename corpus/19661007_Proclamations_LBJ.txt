A Proclamation
In the mighty forests of this Nation our people have an inheritance of majestic beauty which is both a material and a spiritual resource.
With the application of expanding scientific knowledge and technological advances, these forest resources—both public and private—yield a variety of products which contribute a large measure of our Nation's wealth, prosperity, and security.
Our forests
—sustain a vast complex of industries which employ a large segment of our population and contribute to the economic and social improvement of our forested rural areas.
—protect our water supply and our wildlife.
—provide unmatched opportunities for both physical recreation and spiritual uplift.
The Congress, in order to reemphasize the importance and heritage of our forest resources, has by a joint resolution of September 13, 1960 (74 Stat. 898), designated the seven-day period beginning on the third Sunday of October in each year as National Forest Products Week, and has requested the President to issue annually a proclamation calling for the observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, call upon the people of the United States to observe the week beginning October 16, 1966, as National Forest Products Week, with activities and ceremonies designed to direct public attention to the essential role that our forest resources play in stimulating the advancement of our rural economy and in the continued growth and prosperity of the entire Nation.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this seventh day of October in the year of our, Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-first.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
