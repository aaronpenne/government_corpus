A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 transportation has been instrumental in the development of our natural resources and in the industrial and scientific achievements of the United States; and 
Whereas
 our Nation's status as a world Power necessarily requires that we have an efficient and coordinated land, air, and water transportation system which strengthens our national defense and promotes our domestic progress; and 
Whereas
 the continuation of an efficient transportation system, under private ownership and management, is the combined responsibility of all our people-including management and labor, and Federal, State, and local governments; and 
Whereas
 it is appropriate that we recognize the importance to the United States of the transportation industry by setting aside a week as a tribute to the men and women who move this Nation's goods and people; and 
Whereas
 the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 143, approved May 16, 1961, has requested the President to proclaim the week in May of 1961 in which falls the third Friday of that month as National Transportation Week: 
Now, Therefore, I, John F. Kennedy,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning May 14, 1961, as National Transportation Week; and I urge all our people to join in appropriate activities and ceremonies with the various branches of the transportation industry and representatives of governmental agencies in such manner as will afford an opportunity for the people of each community to recognize the importance of a prosperous and efficient transportation system. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed. 
DONE at the City of Washington this sixteenth day of May in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and eighty-fifth. 
JOHN F. KENNEDY 
By the President: 
CHESTER BOWLES, 
Acting Secretary of State.
