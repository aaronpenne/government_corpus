By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
1. 
Whereas
, pursuant to section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as added by section 31 of the act of August 24, 1935, 49 Stat. 773, reenacted by section 1 of the act of June 3, 1937, 50 Stat. 246, and amended by section 3 of the act of July 3, 1948, 62 Stat. 1248, and section 3 of the act of June 28, 1950, 64 Stat. 261 (7 U.S.C. 624), on April 13, 1950, the President caused the United States Tariff Commission to make an investigation to determine whether almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews are being or are practically certain to be imported into the United States under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, certain programs undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts, or to reduce substantially the amount of any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program is being undertaken; and
2. 
Whereas
 the said Commission instituted such an investigation on April 13, 1950, which it has been conducting since that date on a continuing basis and in the course of which it has from time to time reported to the President regarding the need for the imposition of restrictions pursuant to the said section 22 in order to prevent imports of almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, or cashews from rendering ineffective, or materially interfering with, the said programs, or from reducing substantially the amount 01 any product processed in the United States from almonds, pecans, filberts, or walnuts with respect to which any such program is being undertaken; and
3. 
Whereas
 import fees on shelled almonds and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) imposed pursuant to the President's proclamation of September 27, 1952 (Proclamation 2991 '; 17 F. R. 8645), which proclamation was issued under the authority of the said section 22, will cease to apply to such articles entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption after September 30, 1953; and
4. 
Whereas
 further in the course of the said investigation, on September 21, 1953, the said Commission reported to me its findings regarding the need for import restrictions under the said section 22 on almonds, filberts, walnuts, Brazil nuts, and cashews after September 30, 1953; and
5. 
Whereas
, on the basis of such report of September 21, 1953, I find that shelled almonds, and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) are practically certain to be imported into the United States during the period October 1, 1953 to September 30, 1954, both dates inclusive, under such conditions and in such quantities as to render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with the program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture with respect to almonds pursuant to the Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937, as amended, which program will be in operation during such period; and
6. 
Whereas
 I find and declare that the imposition of the import fees hereinafter proclaimed I's shown by such investigation of the Commission to be necessary in order that the entry of almonds described in the fifth recital of this proclamation will not render or tend to render ineffective, or materially interfere with, the said program undertaken by the Department of Agriculture:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, acting under and by virtue of the authority vested in me by the said section 22 of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, as amended, do hereby proclaim that a fee of 5 cents per pound, but not more than 50 per centum ad valorem, shall be imposed upon shelled almonds and blanched, roasted, or otherwise prepared or preserved almonds (not including almond paste) entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during the period October 1, 1953 to September 30, 1954, both dates inclusive, until an aggregate quantity of 7,000,000 pounds of such almonds have been so entered, or withdrawn, during such period, and a fee of 10 cents per pound, but not more than 50 per centum ad valorem, shall be imposed upon such almonds entered, or withdrawn from warehouse, for consumption during such period in excess of an aggregate quantity of 7,000,000 pounds. The said fees shall be in addition to any other duties imposed on the importation of such almonds.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE at the City of Washington this 29th day of September in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-eighth.
DWIGHT D. EISENHOWER

JOHN FOSTER DULLES,
