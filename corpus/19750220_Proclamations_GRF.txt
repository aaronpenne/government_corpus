By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Despite the need to conserve energy, there are still opportunities on our rivers, lakes, and coastal waters to enjoy sailing and other recreational boating. But these opportunities carry the responsibility of practicing safe boating by developing essential skills. 
Recognizing the growth in recreational boating, the Congress, by joint resolution approved June 4, 1958 (72 Stat. 179; 36 U.S.C. 161), requested the President to proclaim annually the week which includes July 4th as National Safe Boating Week. 
Now, Therefore, I, Gerald R. Ford,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate the week beginning June 29, 1975, as National Safe Boating Week. 
I urge all who utilize our waters, in the American tradition of fair play, to provide for the safety of other boaters, as well as themselves, by becoming equipped with basic boating safety knowledge. This information is readily available through numerous safe boating courses offered by governmental and private organizations, such as the United States Coast Guard, the United States Coast Guard Auxiliary, the United States Power Squadrons, the American Red Cross, and the various State agencies. All pleasure boat operators should take advantage of the many available boating safety courses. Only through education can we minimize boating accidents. I further urge all organizations offering boating safety instruction to reach into every possible related recreational area to encourage boating education. 
I also invite the Governors of the States, the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, Guam, and American Samoa, and the Mayor of the District of Columbia to provide for the observance of this week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twentieth day of February, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-ninth. 
GERALD R. FORD
