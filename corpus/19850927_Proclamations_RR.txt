By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The sewing industry annually honors approximately fifty million people who sew at home and approximately forty million people who sew at least part of their wardrobes. Their initiative, creativity, and self-reliance are characteristic of the people of our Nation. 
The home sewing industry generates an estimated $3,500,000,000 annually for the economy of the United States. Home sewing also has enhanced career opportunities for many Americans in fields such as fashion, retail merchandising, design, pattern making, and textiles. Learning the art of sewing in the home or in elementary school home economics classes started many on careers in these fields. 
In recognition of the importance of home sewing to our Nation, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 173, has designated the month of September 1985 as "National Sewing Month," authorizing and requesting the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this month. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim September 1985 as National Sewing Month. I call upon the people of the United States to observe this month with appropriate ceremonies and activities. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-seventh day of September, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-five, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
