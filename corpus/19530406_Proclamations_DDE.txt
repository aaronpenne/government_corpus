A Proclamation
 
Whereas
 the Governing Board of the Pan American Union recommended in 1930 that April 14 be officially observed each year by every member country as Pan American Day; and
Whereas
 the people of the United States of America customarily have joined with their friends and neighbors in the other American republics in observing Pan American Day; and
Whereas
 April 14, 1953, will mark the sixty-third anniversary of the founding of the organization long known as the Pan American Union, which now serves as the General Secretariat of the Organization of American States; and
Whereas
 the forthcoming Tenth Inter-American Conference of the Organization of American States, to be held at Caracas, Venezuela, will demonstrate anew to peoples throughout the world the cooperation and good-will among the neighbors of the Americas which have contributed so much to their spiritual, as well as material, development and strength; and
Whereas
 it is the firm resolve of the Government and the people of the United States of America that the ties binding the twenty-one sovereign and equal American republics shall be maintained and strengthened:
Now, Therefore, I, Dwight D. Eisenhower
, President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim Tuesday, April 14, 1953, as Pan American Day, and I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to arrange for the display of the flag of the United States on all public buildings on that day.
I also invite the Governors of the States, Territories, and possessions of the United States to issue similar proclamations for the observance of Pan American Day. And I urge all interested organizations, and the people generally, to unite in suitable ceremonies commemorative of the founding of the Pan American Union, thereby testifying to the close bonds of friendship existing between the people of the United States and those of the other American republics.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand and caused the Seal of the United States of America to be affixed.
DONE, at the City of Washington this sixth day of April in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and fifty-three, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and seventy-seventh.
