By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
As Americans, we can be proud of our unsurpassed surface transportation system and of the free enterprise that made private sector development of that system possible. 
For the past 100 years, the Interstate Commerce Commission, the first independent administrative agency, has been responsible for regulatory oversight of our surface transportation system. For a century, the Commission has carried out its missions with dedication and with commitment to a national surface transportation system second to none. The Commission's role in regulating transportation has changed constantly and is changing even now; regulation by government is giving way to regulation by market competition, and both the transportation industry and the consumer are better off as a result.
The Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 96, has designated April 3, 1987, as "Interstate Commerce Commission Day" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim April 3, 1987, as Interstate Commerce Commission Day. I invite the people of the United States to observe that day with appropriate ceremonies and activities to recognize the 100th anniversary of the establishment of the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this third day of April, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eightyseven, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and eleventh.
RONALD REAGAN
