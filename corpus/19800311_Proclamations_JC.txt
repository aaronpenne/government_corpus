By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United States of America?more than any other country?is founded upon law. 
The law is a human institution, reflecting the moods, customs and modes of conduct of our people. The law is our own creation. 
The law affects all of us from the cradle to the grave. It touches upon both the tangible and intangible aspects of our lives. The guardians of the law are our courts and those who serve them. 
Our free and self-governing republic owes much to the efforts of the judges and lawyers of our Nation. It is from this body that America has drawn many of its leaders and statesmen. 
This year will mark the 23rd annual observance of Law Day. May 1 has been set aside by joint resolution of the Congress to foster a deeper respect for the law "and understanding of its essential place in the life of every citizen of the United States." 
The theme selected in recognition of Law Day '80 is: "Law and Lawyers' Working for You."
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, invite the American people to observe Thursday, May 1, 1980, as Law Day, U.S.A., and to reflect upon their individual and collective responsibilities for the effective administration of the law. 
I call upon the legal profession, the courts, educators, the media, clergymen, and all interested individuals and organizations to mark the 23rd annual nationwide observance of Law Day, U.S.A., with programs and events appropriate for the occasion. I direct the appropriate officials of the Government to display the flag of the United States on all Government buildings on that day. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this eleventh day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fourth. 
JIMMY CARTER
