By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
The United States is a nation dependent on mobility. Transportation helps maintain our prosperity, ensure our national defense, and bind us together as a people. An efficient transportation network is important to maintain our quality of life and help our Nation conserve precious petroleum. 
Recognizing the fundamental relationship between transportation and our Nation's welfare, the Congress has requested the President to proclaim annually the third Friday in May as National Defense Transportation Day and the week in which that day falls as National Transportation Week (71 Stat. 30, 36 U.S.C. 160; 76 Stat. 69, 36 U.S.C. 166). 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby designate Friday, May 19, 1978, as National Defense Transportation Day, and the week beginning May 14, 1978, as National Transportation Week. 
I urge the Governors of our States and other appropriate officials, organizations concerned with transportation, and the people of the United States to join with the Department of Transportation in observing this day and week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirty-first day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and second.
JIMMY CARTER
