By the President of the United States Of America
A Proclamation
 
The idea of a fair trial, a legal scholar has observed, "has been the greatest contribution made to civilization by our Anglo-American polity." For twenty-five years, the members of the American Trial Lawyers Association have sought to translate this noble inspiration into an everyday reality for those whose disputes and grievances must be settled in a court of law.
Through the adversary process, these lawyers have now established a long and proud tradition and have shown that the methods and values of the trial advocate may serve as a model for the just resolution of disputes among men. Their continuing commitment to fair and orderly trials has become an essential part of the administration of justice in America.
In honor of the American Trial Lawyers Association on the occasion of its twenty-fifth anniversary, the Congress, by House Joint Resolution 714, has designated the week beginning August 1, 1971, as American Trial Lawyers Week and has requested the President to encourage appropriate observance of that week.
Now, Therefore, I, Richard Nixon
, President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon each American, during American Trial Lawyers Week, to renew his commitment to enhance the administration of justice for the public good; and I direct the appropriate Government officials to display the flag of the United States on all public buildings on Monday, August 2, 1971.
In Witness Whereof
, I have hereunto set my hand this thirtieth day of July, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred seventy-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred ninety-sixth.
RICHARD NIXON
