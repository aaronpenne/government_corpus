By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
For nearly fifty years, voluntary school safety patrols have performed a distinguished service to other children going to and from school. The volunteer patrol has not only safeguarded countless young lives; it has, by example, taught obedience to traffic laws and the observance of safe pedestrian practices.
During this period of almost half a century, more than sixteen million youngsters have given freely of their time that their fellow students might walk to school safely.
With the encouragement and assistance of the schools, parent-teacher associations, police and traffic engineers, motor clubs, and others, the School Safety Patrol Program has helped bring about a significant improvement in the traffic death and injury rates of school children.
To give well-earned recognition to the accomplishments and efforts of school safety patrols, the Congress, by a joint resolution approved March 29, 1968, has designated the second week of May of 1968 as National School Safety Patrol Week, and has requested the President to issue a proclamation calling for its observance.
Now, Therefore, I, Lyndon B. Johnson,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby call upon the people of the United States to observe the week of May 5 to 11, 1968, as National School Safety Patrol Week, with ceremonies and activities designed to give honor and recognition to school patrols. I urge that the future success of the patrol program be assured by the continuing support of the general public.
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this 29th day of March, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and sixty-eight, and of the Independence of the United States of America the one hundred and ninety-second.
LYNDON B. JOHNSON
