By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
I find that continued implementation of the Emergency Building Temperature Restrictions, Energy Conservation Plan No. 2, is required in the national interest. This Plan was transmitted by me to the Congress on March 1, 1979, and approved by resolution of each House of Congress in the manner provided by law. 
This Conservation Plan was implemented by me approximately eighteen months ago because it was clear in view of the unstable world production of crude oil that we could not rely on imports to meet our normal demand. On April 15, 1980, I continued this Plan in effect because of the decline in worldwide crude oil production compared to the previous year, the prohibition on imports of Iranian oil, and the threat to the stability of commerce in the countries of the oil-producing Persian Gulf resulting from tensions between Iran and Iraq and the Soviet Union's actions in Afghanistan. 
Since then, war has broken out between Iran and Iraq, substantially interrupting crude oil production in those countries. This disruption is of significant scope and is likely to be of substantial duration. New worldwide crude oil production is now and is likely to continue to be at least two million barrels a day less than consumption through the first quarter of 1981. This shortage has resulted in increased petroleum prices, and the combined effects of the shortage and present and future price increases resulting from it may have a major adverse impact on the national economy. The war between Iran and Iraq, as well as border tensions between Syria and Jordan and the Soviet actions in Afghanistan, have also greatly increased the threat to other sources of .petroleum supplies in the Middle East. Should other disruptions result, they are likely to be of an emergency nature and to further disrupt the Nation's economy. 
Because of these events, the risk to the Nation from our reliance on insecure oil imports is greater than when the Plan was renewed approximately nine months ago, as well as when the Plan was implemented approximately eighteen months ago. Under applicable law, the findings that a shortage of energy supply requires implementation of the Plan must be considered anew every nine months. I therefore renew the findings and determination contained in Proclamation No. 4667 of July 10, 1979, and renewed in Proclamation No. 4750 of April 15, 1980, under sections 201 (b) and 3 (8) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. Sections 6261 (b) and 6202(8)). 
Now, Therefore, I, Jimmy Carter,
 President of the United States of America, by the authority vested in me by the Constitution and laws of the United States, including section 201 (b) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6261 (b)), do hereby proclaim that: 
1-101. The finding and determination under sections 3(8) and 201(b) of the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (42 U.S.C. 6202(8) and 6261(b)) contained in Proclamation No. 4667 of July 10, 1979, and renewed in Proclamation No. 4750 of April 15, 1980, are hereby renewed.
1-102. This Proclamation shall be transmitted to the Congress. 
1-103. The provisions of the Emergency Building Temperature Restrictions, Energy Conservation Contingency Plan No. 2 (44 FR 12911 of March 8, 1979) and the regulations thereunder, or any amendments thereto, shall continue in effect until October 16, 1981, unless earlier rescinded. 
1-104. In accordance with the provisions of this Plan and the regulations thereunder, the Secretary of Energy is hereby authorized to continue the administration of the program in all respects. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this thirteenth day of January, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-one, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and fifth.
