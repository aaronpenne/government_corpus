By the President of the United States of America
A Proclamation
 
Since our days as a young nation, the American people have always banded together to meet the needs of our citizens and our communities. Awareness, generosity, and the determination to find solutions to community problems are traits that have long kept our country strong. We have always been a people who give of ourselves to help those less fortunate in a way that no government or institution by itself can. 
Prevention of homelessness is a complex challenge that faces us today. Although estimates of the exact number of homeless vary widely, innovative approaches to this problem by all elements of our society are needed. And in few other areas has each segment of our society been so involved, with so much dedication and sacrifice. Federal, State, and local governments, national service organizations, corporations, churches, synagogues, and voluntary groups, over the years, have worked together to provide food, shelter, and comfort for the needy. 
Now, I call upon all Americans to come together in partnership and resolve to invigorate their commitment to reach out to their fellow Americans in need. Let us all experience the blessings of compassion and goodwill that come from the joy of helping others. 
To increase public awareness of the problem of homelessness, the Congress, by Senate Joint Resolution 347, has designated the week beginning June 22, 1986, as "National Homelessness Awareness Week" and authorized and requested the President to issue a proclamation in observance of this event. 
Now, Therefore, I, Ronald Reagan,
 President of the United States of America, do hereby proclaim the week beginning June 22, 1986, as National Homelessness Awareness Week. 
In Witness Whereof,
 I have hereunto set my hand this twenty-fifth day of June, in the year of our Lord nineteen hundred and eighty-six, and of the Independence of the United States of America the two hundred and tenth.
RONALD REAGAN
